<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>This volume is the first to offer in monographic form a
detailed treatment of the popular assemblies of ancient Rome.
Necessarily much of the material in it may be found in earlier
works; but recent progress in the field, involving a reaction
against certain theories of Niebuhr and Mommsen affecting
the comitia, justifies a systematic presentation of existing
knowledge of the subject. This task has required patient labor
extending through many years. The known sources and practically
all the modern authorities have been utilized. A determination
to keep free from conventional ideas, so as to look
at the sources freshly and with open mind, has brought views
of the assemblies not found in other books. The reader is
earnestly requested not to reject an interpretation because it
seems new but to examine carefully the grounds on which
it is given. In general the aim has been to follow a conservative
historical method as opposed to the radical juristic, to build
up generalizations on facts rather than to estimate sources by
the criterion of a preconceived theory. The primary object
of the volume, however, is not to defend a point of view but
to serve as a book of study and reference for those who are
interested in the history, law, and constitution of ancient Rome
and in comparative institutional research.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the volume, I have been generously
aided by my colleagues in Columbia University. To Professor
William M. Sloane, Head of the Department of History, I owe
a great debt of gratitude for kindly sympathy and encouragement
in the work. It is an especial good fortune that the
proofs have been read by Professor James C. Egbert. Many
improvements are due to his scholarship and editorial experience.
Professor George N. Olcott has advised me on various
numismatic matters, and I am indebted to Dr. John L. Gerig<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
for information on two or three etymologies. The proofs have
also been read and corrections made by Dr. Richard R. Blews
of Cornell University. It is a pleasure to remember gratefully
these able friends who have helped me with their special knowledge,
and to add the name of Mr. Frederic W. Erb of the
Columbia University Library, whose courtesy has facilitated the
borrowing of books for the study from other institutions.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding every effort to make the work accurate,
mistakes and inconsistencies will doubtless be found in it, and
I shall thankfully welcome suggestions from any reader for
its further correction and improvement.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE POPULUS AND ITS EARLIEST POLITICAL DIVISIONS</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I. <i>The Populus</i></h4>

<p>The derivation of populus, “people,” “folk,” is unknown.
Attempts have been made to connect it with populari, “to
devastate,” so as to give it primarily a military signification—perhaps
simply “the army.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In the opinion of others it is
akin to plēnus, plēbes, πλῆθος, πολύς, πίμπλημι,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in which case
it would signify “multitude,” “mass,” with the idea of collective
strength, which might readily pass into “army” as a secondary
meaning.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Fundamentally personal, it included all those individuals,
not only the grown men but their families as well, who
collectively made up the state, whether Roman or foreign,
monarchical or republican.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Only in a transferred sense did it
apply to territory.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The ancient definition, “an association
based on the common acceptance of the same body of laws and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
on the general participation in public benefits,”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> is doubtless
too abstract for the beginnings of Rome. Citizenship—membership
in the populus—with all that it involved is elaborately
defined by the Roman jurists;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> but for the earlier period it will
serve the purpose of the present study to mention that the
three characteristic public functions of the citizen were military
service, participation in worship, and attendance at the assembly.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
In a narrower sense populus signifies “the people,”
“masses,” in contrast with the magistrates or with the senate,
as in the well known phrase, senatus populusque Romanus.</p>

<h4>II. <i>The Three Primitive Tribes</i></h4>

<p>The Romans believed that the three tribes which composed
the primitive populus were created by one act in close relation
with the founding of the city.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> For some unknown reason
they were led to connect the myth of Titus Tatius, the
eponymous hero of the Tities,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> with the Quirinal,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and with the
Sabines,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> who were generally supposed to have occupied that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
hill.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Consequently some of their historians felt compelled to
defer their account of the institution of the tribes till they had
told of the union of the Sabines with the Romans, which at the
same time gave them an opportunity to derive the names of the
curiae from those of the Sabine women. Varro,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> however, who
protests against this derivation, refers the organization of the
people in the three tribes to an earlier date, connecting it
immediately with the founding of Rome. Though he affirmed
that one tribe was named after Romulus, another after Titus
Tatius, and the third, less positively, after an Etruscan Lucumo,
Caeles Vibenna, who came to the aid of Romulus against Titus
Tatius,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> neither he nor any other ancient writer identified the Tities
with the Sabines, whose quarter in the city was really unknown,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
or the Luceres with an Etruscan settlement under Caeles
whether in the Vicus Tuscus<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> or on the Caelian hill.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Since
the Romans knew the tribe in no other relation than as a part
of the state, they could not have thought of their city as consisting
originally of a single tribe, to which a second and afterward
a third were added, or that any one of these three tribes
had ever been an independent community. These views are
modern;<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> there is no trace of them in the ancient writers.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
Even if it could be proved that they took this point of view, the
question at issue would not thereby be settled; for no genuine
tradition regarding the origin of the primitive tribes came down
to the earliest annalists; the only possible knowledge they possessed
on this point was deduced from the names of the tribes
and from surviving institutions presumably connected with them
in the period of their existence.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Under these circumstances
modern speculations as to their independent character and
diverse nationality seem absurd. The proper method of solving
the problem is to test and to supplement the scant sources
by a comparative study of the institution.</p>

<p>The low political vitality of the three primitive Roman tribes,
as of the corresponding Greek phylae,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> when we first meet
with them in history, points to the artificiality of these groups—a
condition indicated further both by their number and by
their occurrence in other Italian states.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Far from being confined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
to Rome, the tripartite division of the community belonged
to many Greek and to most Italian peoples,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and has entered
largely into the organization of communities and nations the
world over.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> A derivation of tribus, Umbrian trifu, accepted
by many scholars, connects it with the number three.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The
wide use of this conventional number, and more particularly the
regular recurrence of the same three Dorian tribes in many
Dorian cities—as of the same four Ionic tribes in many Ionic
cities<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>—and of the same three Latin (or Etruscan?) tribes
in several old Latin cities, could not result from chance combinations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
in all these places, but point unmistakably to the systematic
imitation of a common pattern. That pattern must be
ultimately sought in the pre-urban populus, ἔθνος, folk. If we
assume that before the rise of city-states the Ionian folk was
organized in four tribes (phylae) and the Dorian and Latin folks
in three tribes, we shall have a condition such as will satisfactorily
explain the tribal organization of the city-states which
grew up within the areas occupied by these three folks respectively.
The thirty votes of the Latins may be best explained
by assuming a division of their populus into three tribes,
subdivided each into ten groups corresponding to the Roman
curiae. Whereas in Umbria the decay of the pre-urban populus
allowed its tribes to become independent,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> in Latium a
development in that direction was prevented by the rise of
city-states, which completely overshadowed the preëxisting organization.</p>

<p>The Italian city-state grew not from a tribe or a combination
of tribes, but from the pagus,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> “canton,” a district of the pre-urban
populus with definite consecrated boundaries,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> usually
centering in an oppidum—a place of defence and refuge.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In
the beginning the latter enjoyed no superior right over the
territory in which it was situated.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> A pagus became a populus
at the point of time when it asserted its political independence
of the folk. The new state organized itself in tribes and curiae
after the pattern of the folk. In the main this arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
was artificial, yet it must have taken some account of existing
ties of blood.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> At the same time the oppidum became an urbs<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>—a
city, the seat of government of the new populus. Thus
arose the city-state. In the case of Rome several oppida with
parts of their respective pagi<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> were merged in one urbs—that
known as the city of the four regions.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Urbs and ager excluded
each other, just as the oppidani contrasted with the pagani;<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
but both were included in the populus.</p>

<p>Most ancient writers represent the three tribes as primarily
local,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and the members as landowners from the founding of
the city.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Although their view may be a mere inference from
the character of the so-called Servian tribes, the continuity of
name from the earlier to the later institution points to some
degree of similarity between them. It can be easily understood,
too, how in time the personal feature might have so overcome
the local as to make the old tribes appear to be based on birth
in contrast with the territorial aspect of the new.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>It was probably on the institution of the later tribes that the
earlier were dissolved. They left their names to the three double
centuries of patrician knights.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Their number appears also as
a factor in the number of curiae, of senators, and of members
of the great sacerdotal colleges. Other survivals may be found
in the name “tribunus,” in the tribuni militum, the tribuni<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
celerum,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> the ludus Troiae,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and less certainly in the Sodales
Titii.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<h4>III. <i>The Curiae</i></h4>

<p>The curia as well as the tribe was a common Italian institution.
We know that it belonged to the Etruscans,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> the Latins,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
and several other peoples of Italy.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> There were ten curiae to
the tribe, making thirty in all.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The association was composed,
not of gentes as many have imagined, but of families.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> For the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
performance of its social and religious functions it had a house
of assembly, also called curia,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> in which the members—curiales—gathered
for religious festivals. The place of meeting was
a part of an edifice belonging to the collective curiae. In historical
time there were two such buildings—the Curiae Veteres<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
on the northeast slope of the Palatine near the Arch of Constantine,
containing seven curial meeting-places, and the Novae
Curiae<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> near the Compitum Fabricium, containing the others.
Their deities were Juno<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and Tellus;<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and their chief festivals
were the Fornacalia and the Fordicidia.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> As the worship was
public, the expense was paid by the state.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> At the head of the
curia stood the curio—who in historical time was merely a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
priest<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>—assisted in his religious functions by his wife and
children,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> by a lictor<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and a flamen.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The fact that the curio
had these officials proves that he was originally a magistrate.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
One of the curiones the people elected curio maximus to exercise
general supervision over the worship and festivals of the association.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Another function of the curiae was political. The grown
male members, meeting in the comitium, constituted the earliest
assembly organized in voting divisions—the comitia curiata—in
which each curia cast a single vote.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Religious and political
functions the curia continued to exercise far down into
historical time; and for that reason they have never been doubted
by the moderns. For the primitive period Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> ascribes
to them military functions as well. His idea is that the three
original tribes furnished military divisions each under a tribune,
and the curiae as subdivisions of the tribe furnished companies,
commanded each by a curio chosen for his valor.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Doubtless
the writer fairly describes the military system which Rome employed
before the introduction of the phalanx,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and which corresponds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
closely with the system prevalent among the early
Greeks,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Germans,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and other European peoples.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The military
organization was everywhere a parallel of the civil. The Roman
army, however, was by no means identical with the curiate assembly,
for many belonged to the tribes and the curiae who for
various reasons were exempt from military service.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>It is probable, too, that the curiae, as well as the tribes,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> were
territorial divisions. Not only have we the authority of Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
that each curia occupied a district of the state, but also
two of the seven known curial names—Foriensis and Veliensis<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>—are
local. Though the two mentioned refer to places within
the city, the country people were also included in the associations.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p class="tb">Since Niebuhr the opinion has generally prevailed that the
curia was composed of gentes. A passage which at first glance
seems to have a bearing on the question is Dion. Hal. ii. 7. 4:
“Romulus divided the curiae into decades, each commanded by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
leader, who in the language of the country is called decurion.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
The word decurion proves, however, that in speaking of decades
Dionysius is thinking of the military divisions called decuriae,
each commanded by a decurion. In historical times the troop
of cavalry—turma—was divided into three decuriae of ten
each, as the word itself indicates. There were accordingly three
decurions to the turma, and ten turmae ordinarily went with the
legion.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> From Varro<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> we learn that the three primitive tribes
furnished turmae and decuriae of cavalry, the decuriae commanded
by decurions. Dionysius accordingly refers to military
companies—either to the well known decuriae of cavalry or to
corresponding companies of footmen which probably existed
before the adoption of the phalanx.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Had he meant gentes, he
would have used the corresponding Greek word γένη. Niebuhr<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
inferred from this passage that each curia was divided into ten
gentes, making three hundred gentes for the entire state; but a
careful interpretation shows that no reference to the gentes is
intended. We cannot infer therefore from this citation that the
curia was divided into gentes.</p>

<p>The other passage relative to the question is Gellius xv. 27.
4,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> in which Laelius Felix states that the voting in the comitia
curiata was by genera hominum in contrast with the census et
aetas of the centuriate assembly and with the regiones et loca
of the comitia tributa. Niebuhr identifies genera with gentes.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
It is clear, however, that in this passage Laelius is not concretely
defining the voting units of the various assemblies, but
is stating in a general way the principles underlying their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
organization into voting units. In the comitia centuriata the
principle is wealth and age; census et aetas is not to be identified
with centuria or with any other group of individuals in this
assembly. In like manner regiones et loca expresses the principle
of organization of the tribal assembly; or if used concretely,
it must designate the tribes themselves, and not
subdivisions of the tribes, for none existed. Correspondingly
genera hominum signifies that the principle of organization of
the curiate assembly is hereditary connection; but so far as the
expression is applied concretely, it must denote the curiae themselves
not subdivisions of these associations. The curia, a
religious, social, and political group based on birth, might well
be called genus hominum in contrast with the local tribe and
with the century, composed artificially of men of similar wealth
and age. It is well known, too, that voting within the curiae
was not by gentes but by heads.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> As no other passage from
the sources, besides these two, has even the appearance of
lending support to the proposition advanced by Niebuhr, and
favored by others, that the curia was a group of gentes, we
may conclude that this proposition is groundless. The result is
that the gens had no connection with the comitial organization.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SOCIAL COMPOSITION OF THE PRIMITIVE POPULUS</span></h3>

</div>

<p>This chapter<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> is primarily an inquiry into the social composition
of the comitia curiata. At the same time it seeks to solve
a problem which is doubtless the most fundamental in the early
political and constitutional history of Rome. The result we
reach will determine our conception of the whole course of
constitutional development, and of the accompanying political
struggles, to the complete equalization of the social ranks. For
if we believe, as do many of the moderns,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> that the primitive
Roman state was made up exclusively of patricians, we are
forced to the conclusion that the constitutional development to
the passing of the Hortensian laws centred in the gradual admission
of the plebeians and the clients to citizenship—perhaps
even in the amalgamation of two distinct peoples. If on the
other hand we take the ground that from the beginning the
plebeians and the clients were citizens and voted in the comitia
curiata, we must think of these inferior classes as struggling
through the early history of their country for the acquisition
not of citizenship but of various rights and privileges, social,
economic, religious, and political, formerly monopolized by a
patrician aristocracy. In attempting to solve the problem here
proposed it will be advantageous to consider (1) the ancient
view, (2) the conventional modern view, (3) the comparative-sociological
view.</p>

<h4>I. <i>The Ancient View</i></h4>

<p>The three social classes of freemen—plebeians, patricians,
and clients—were formed within the citizen body by official
recognition of existing distinctions not of nationality but of
worth. The first step in the process was the differentiation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the patricians from the plebeians. According to Cicero,
Romulus constituted a number of chief men into a royal council,
the senate, whose members he so highly esteemed as to have
them called patres, and their children patricians.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Cicero thinks
of the multitude as existing at first without a politically recognized
nobility, yet showing natural distinctions of worth. By
calling into the senate the ablest and best men, the state ennobled
them and their families.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Livy’s<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> view is similar:
Romulus selected from the multitude a hundred senators, whom
he named patres, and whose descendants were called patricians.
They were chosen because of their wisdom;<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> on that ground
the state granted them nobility,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> which accordingly in Rome, as
in every early community, was founded on personal merit.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> In
the more detailed theory of Dionysius,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Romulus “distinguished
those who were eminent for their birth and celebrated for their
virtue, and whom he knew to be rich in the account of those
times and who had children, from the obscure and mean and
poor. The lower class he called plebeians, Greek δημοτικοί,
and the higher patres, either because they were older than the
others, or had children, or were of higher birth, or for all these
reasons.... The most trustworthy historians of the Roman
constitution assert that owing to these facts they were called
patres and their descendants patricians.” According to Plutarch,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
“Romulus, after forming the army, employed the rest of
the people as the citizen body (δῆμος); the multitude he called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
populus, and appointed a hundred nobles to be councillors,
whom he called patricians, and their assembly the senate.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>There can be no doubt, therefore, as to the opinion of the
ancient writers. They believed that from the beginning social
distinctions existed naturally within the populus Romanus, and
that these distinctions were made the basis of an official division
of the people into nobles and commons, patricii and plebs, by
the government. This view is not only reasonable in itself, but
is supported, as we shall see, by analogies drawn from many
other states.</p>

<p>All the sources make the patriciate depend upon connection
with the senate, Dionysius alone showing some inconsistency on
this point.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Why the senators were called patres the ancients
give various reasons. Cicero<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> thinks patres a term of endearment;
Sallust<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> believes that the name was applied either because
of age or because of the similarity of their duty; Livy<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
sets it down as a title of honor; Festus<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> thinks chiefly of their
age and wisdom; Paulus,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> his epitomator, suggests that they
were so called because they divided their lands among the
poorer class as fathers among children; Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> gives three
possible reasons, (1) greater age, (2) possession of children,
(3) family reputation. The sources generally agree in representing
the patres as men who in age, honor, authority and
duty stood toward the rest of the citizens as a father toward his
children, and in identifying these social-political patres with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
senators.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> An examination of the word itself will tend to confirm
the ancient view. It seems to have originally signified
“protector,” “keeper,” “nourisher,”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> hence “owner,” “master.”
Pater familias is nourisher, protector, and master of a household.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
In late Roman law the term continued to refer not
necessarily to actual parentage but rather to the legal position
of the head of a household;<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> in fact it is only in a distantly
derived sense that pater comes to signify the male parent.
Ideas early attaching to the word, accordingly, are those of
power or authority and age. The senate, as this word indicates,
was originally made up of elderly men, senatores, maiores
natu.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> It would be natural to call them patres because of their
authority over the community or of their age. As a designation
of rank, pater, excepting in jest, is always plural—an
indication that the authority and dignity did not attach to the
individual noble but to the senators collectively; they were collectively
patres of the community, not individually patres of
children, clients or gentes.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> But when in time a limited number
of families monopolized the senate, the term could easily be
extended to the entire privileged circle, meaning those with
hereditary right to authority over the rest of the community.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
Though in the sources the patres are generally senators the
word is sometimes synonymous with patricii.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>Regarding patricius the Romans reasoned with somewhat
less care. They were right in deriving it from pater, but they
made it signify “descended from,” whereas in fact it means
“belonging to,”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and designates accordingly the families of the
political patres. Probably it was formed after patres began to
be applied to the entire governing class—a development which
would tend to throw the latter word back to its earlier and
narrower sense.</p>

<p>Had the investigation of these words on the part of the
ancients rested at this point, all would have been well; but an
unfortunate guess as to the derivation of patricii by some unknown
antiquarian has brought into the study of the social
ranks unutterable confusion lasting down to the present day.
This conjecture derives patricius from patrem ciere, making it
signify “one who can cite a father.” The attempted etymology,
clearly a failure, would perhaps have been harmless, had it not
connected itself with the ambiguous word ingenuus. Cincius<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
says, “Those used to be called patricians who are now called
ingenui.” Livy has the two ideas in mind when he represents
a plebeian orator as inquiring, “Have ye never heard it said
that those first created patricians were not beings sent down
from heaven, but such as could cite their fathers, that is, nothing
more than ingenui? I can now cite my father—a consul—and
my son will be able to cite a grandfather.”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> There should
be no doubt as to the meaning of these passages; the antiquarian
who conjectured that patricius was derived from patrem
ciere, and therefore defined patricii as those who could cite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
their fathers, meant merely those who had distinguished fathers,
and hence were of respectable birth. Ordinarily in extant
Latin literature ingenui are simply the freeborn; and in making
Appius Claudius Crassus in 368 include in the term the
whole body of citizens Livy<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> dates this meaning back to the
period before the Licinian-Sextian laws. Elsewhere are indications
that in early times ingenui connoted rather respectable
birth, and so applied especially to the patricians.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The quotations
from Cincius and the attempted derivation of patricius
from patrem ciere, accordingly, are sufficiently explained without
resorting to the strange hypothesis, held by some, that
in primitive Rome the patricians were the only men of free
birth.</p>

<p>In summarizing the ancient view as to the origin and nature
of the patriciate, it will be enough to say that the king chose
from the people men who were eminent for the experience of
age, for ability and reputation, to sit in his council, the senate;
the men so distinguished were called patres, whereas the adjective
patricius applied as well to their families—the patricii
being those who could cite illustrious fathers.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> From this point
of view the Roman nobility did not differ from that of most
other countries.</p>

<p>The plebs,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> then, were the mass of common freemen, from
whom the nobility was differentiated in the way described above.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
From the ancient point of view they existed from the beginning,
prior even to the patriciate itself.</p>

<p>It is equally true that in the opinion of the ancients the plebs
were prior to the clients. Cicero<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> records that Romulus distributed
the plebs in clientage among the chief men; Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
adds that he gave the plebeians liberty to choose their patrons
from among the patricians. Thus far their view is in complete
accord with modern sociology, which teaches that such class
distinctions first arise through the differentiation of freemen.
Although aware of the fact that clientage existed in other states
which were presumably older than Rome,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> her historians doubtless
felt that the institution could have been legalized in their
own country by recognition only on the part of the government.
They did not, however, work out a consistent theory of the
relation between this class and the plebeians. Certain passages<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
hint, though they do not expressly assert, that at one epoch
all the plebeians were in clientage, whereas in their accounts of
political struggles the ancient writers uniformly array clients
against plebeians almost from the beginning of the state.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The
latter view is historically better founded.</p>

<p>There must have been various origins of clientage, with corresponding
gradations of privilege. The libertini were citizens
with straitly limited rights; other clients, certainly the greater
part of the class, not only followed their patron to war<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and to
the forum,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> but also testified and brought accusations in the
courts<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and voted in the assemblies;<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and when the plebeians
gained the right to hold offices the clients were admitted along
with them to the same privilege.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> In his relation with the state,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
therefore, the ordinary client did not differ essentially from the
plebeian.</p>

<p>From the preceding examination of the social ranks it at once
becomes evident that the ancients made the populus comprise
both patricians and plebeians; in further proof of their view
may be cited the following juristic definition: “Plebs differs
from populus in that by the word populus all the citizens are
meant, including even the patricians, whereas plebs signifies
the rest of the citizens, excepting the patricians.”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Since the
sources generally consider the patricians the descendants of the
hundred original senators,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> they cannot help regarding the populus
as composed chiefly of plebeians. In common speech the
term, like our word people, often applies to the lower class as
distinguished from the higher, in which sense it is interchangeable
with plebs; often, too, it signifies the people in contrast
with the senate.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> It is clear, then, as Mommsen has pointed
out,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> that if populus signifies first the whole body of citizens and
secondly the commons as distinguished from the nobles, it could
not possibly have as a third equivalent the patricians as distinguished
from the plebeians. In certain formulae found in
addresses, wills, prayers, and oracles, populus is so joined with
plebs (populus plebesque or the like) as to suggest the possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
meaning patricians.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The combination of the two words with
senatus,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> however, reveals at once the overlapping of the terms
so joined. In these passages reference is to the modes by
which an individual may approach the state; he may address
the consuls, praetors, or plebeian tribunes, and in the same way
the senate, populus, or plebs.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Hence in these formulae,
merely representing groups of institutions through which the
state is accustomed to act, the word populus does not apply
solely to the patricians, and the same may be said of its use
in all other connections. We may conclude, therefore, that
the Latin language gives no hint of an exclusively patrician
populus.</p>

<p>Regarding the populus as made up of patricians, plebeians,
and clients, our sources necessarily ascribe the same social composition
to its divisions, the three old tribes and the thirty
curiae.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> With perfect consistency they mention repeated enlargements
of the populus and of the tribes and curiae, through
the admission of masses of aliens, most of whom must have
remained plebeian. In fact the sources uniformly represent all
the kings as freely admitting conquered aliens without exception
to the citizenship and to the tribes and the curiae, even
compelling some forcibly to enter this condition.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Might the plebeians and clients belong in a restricted sense
to the populus and curiae, and yet remain so far inferior to the
patricians as to be excluded from the political meetings of the
curiae—the comitia curiata? There can be no uncertainty as
to the answer to this question, for the ancient writers agree that
the comitia curiata included plebeians and clients as well as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
patricians.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Not only did the lower classes attend this assembly,
but they also voted in it, and constituted the majority.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<h4>II. <span class="smcap">The Conventional Modern View</span></h4>

<p>The passages cited above suffice to prove that the ancient
writers thought of the populus, and consequently of the comitia
curiata, as composed from the earliest times of patricians,
clients, and plebeians. Another question, far more difficult, is
whether the ancients were right in their view.</p>

<p>As none of the authorities on whom we directly depend for
our knowledge of Roman affairs lived earlier than the last century
of the republic, they could have had no first-hand acquaintance
with primitive Roman conditions, but must have drawn
their information concerning the remote past from earlier writers—the
annalists—now lost. Niebuhr, who in the opening
years of the last century introduced the modern method of
investigating Roman history, was convinced that writers of the
late republic and of the empire, lacking historical perspective
and interpreting their sources in the false light of existing or
recent conditions, came to wrong conclusions in regard to the
primitive Roman state. He believed he could point to instances
of such misunderstanding, and he thought it within the power of
a well-equipped modern historian to eliminate much of the error
so as to come near to the standpoint of the earlier and more
trustworthy annalists.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The position of Niebuhr has in the main proved untenable.
Notwithstanding all the source-sifting of modern times, pursued
most zealously by the Germans, we are obliged to admit
that it is rarely possible with any fair degree of certainty to
discover the view of an annalist on a given subject excepting in
the few cases in which the citation is by name. We must also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
admit that though Cicero and the Augustan writers might misinterpret
Fabius Pictor in minor details, it is inconceivable that
they should fail to understand his presentation of so fundamental
a subject as the character of the original populus or the composition
of the earliest assembly. Present scholarship accordingly
insists that in such weighty matters there was no essential difference
of view between earlier and later writers.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>These considerations have simplified but not solved the
problem. Scholars now agree that no contemporary account
of the regal period—ending 509 (?) <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>—ever existed; and
even if it be conceded that the earliest Roman annalist—Fabius
Pictor, born about 250 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>—had access to traditional or documentary<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
information reaching back to the close of that period,
no historian will admit such a possibility for the beginnings of
Rome. It follows then that for the origin and character of her
earliest institutions Cicero, Livy, and Dionysius, or their sources,
have relied wholly on inference from later conditions, in so far
as they have not resorted to outright invention. Though with
their abundant material they were in a far better position for
making such deductions than we are, they lacked the experience
and the acute critical method of the moderns.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Of the
three writers above mentioned—our main sources for the subject
under discussion—Cicero was essentially an orator, Dionysius a
rhetorician, and Livy, though historian in name, was in spirit
rhetorical and dramatic rather than critical. Naturally therefore
they or their sources, who on the whole were equally uncritical,
made mistakes in the difficult work of drawing inferences
as to the history and institutions of the regal period.
Such is the view of historians today. It was formerly argued
that Dionysius, a rhetorician and a Greek, failed in spite of his
twenty-two years of preparation at Rome to understand the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
spirit and character of the Roman constitution and has therefore
been an especial fountain of error;<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> but it is now clear
that though in his treatment of early Rome he shows far greater
amplitude than Livy and is for that reason proportionally more
liable to error in detail, he follows good Roman sources for
institutions, and is in this field, with the reservation here mentioned,
not essentially inferior to the extant native writers.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Considering the sources untrustworthy and following certain
clues which he believed they afforded to a right understanding
of the annalists, Niebuhr came to his theory as to the composition
of the primitive Roman state. Although he asserts that it
was made up of “patrons and clients,”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> he does not rest satisfied
with this view, but proceeds to trace clientage to the following
origins, as though in his opinion this institution did not
exist from the beginning: (1) some native Siculians perhaps,
who were conquered by Latin invaders; (2) strangers settling
on Roman territory and choosing a Roman as protector;
(3) inhabitants of communities which were obliged to take
refuge under Roman protection; (4) manumitted slaves.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Logically
he goes back to a state made up exclusively of patricians.</p>

<p>He sought evidence for this hypothesis in the scheme of
tribal organization of Rome. The primitive city was divided
into three tribes, thirty curiae and, as he believed, three hundred
gentes. As no one could be a citizen without membership
in a gens,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and as the patricians alone were active members of
the gentes,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> it must follow that the patricians alone were citizens.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
It is doubtful whether he would have proposed this
hypothesis had it not been for the analogy of the Attic tribal
scheme. An imperfect quotation from the lost part of Aristotle’s
<i>Constitution of Athens</i><a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> seems to signify that the Athenian
state was once divided into four tribes (φυλαί), twelve phratries
and three hundred and sixty gentes (γένη). On this authority
Niebuhr supposes that the phratry was a group of gentes, and he
assumes further that both phratries and gentes were composed
exclusively of eupatrids.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> But the suppositions (1) that there
were three hundred and sixty gentes, (2) that the phratry was a
group of gentes, (3) that both phratries and gentes contained
only eupatrids are contradicted by well known facts. From the
earliest times the Greek tribes and phratries included commons
as well as nobles. This is true of the Homeric Greeks,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and a
law of Draco<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> proves that the early Attic phratry comprised
both nobles and commons. In historical times all citizens belonged
to the phratries; whereas but few were members of the
gentes.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Most of the gentes were in fact composed of the old
landed nobility, though a few, like the Chalkidae and the
Eupyridae, were apparently industrial guilds, which had received
the privileges of the gentes. So far therefore from supporting
Niebuhr in his peculiar view of the Roman gentes and curiae,
the Attic analogy militates in every way against him. As his
assumption that the curia was a group of ten gentes has already
been disproved,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> it remains only to consider whether the gens
was an exclusively patrician institution. From the circumstance
that patricianism is not given as an element of Scaevola’s definition,
quoted by Cicero,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> we may at once conclude that in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
time plebeians, too, were gentiles. This conclusion is supported
by a variety of evidence.</p>

<p>Several plebeian gentes are mentioned, including the Minucia
and the Octavia,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> the Lutatia,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> the Calpurnia,<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> the Domitia,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> the
Fonteia,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> the Aurelia,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and the Licinia.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Some gentes comprised
both patrician and plebeian families, as the Cassia,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> the Claudia,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
the Cornelia,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> the Manlia,<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> the Papiria,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> the Publilia or Poplilia,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
the Aebutia,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and the Servilia.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Not only do the sources refer
to several plebeian gentes by name, but they clearly imply in
other ways the existence of such associations. Livy<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> expresses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
the patrician sentiment that “it would seem an affront to the
gods for honors to be vulgarized and for the distinction between
gentes to be confused at auspicated comitia” (by the election of
plebeians to the consular tribunate). “The distinction between
gentes” can only mean the distinction between patrician and
plebeian gentes—an interpretation confirmed by a similar statement
of Cicero<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> to Clodius, who had passed by arrogation from
a patrician to a plebeian gens: “You have disturbed the sacra
and contaminated the gentes, both the one you have deserted
and the one you have defiled” (by your admission into it). To
our other proofs we may add the consideration that the very
expression gentes patriciae<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> implies the existence of plebeian
gentes. It is natural then that Varro<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> should make gentilitas a
condition of men in general. In asserting that there were a
thousand gentile names the same authority<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> must have included
those of plebeians, for scarcely a hundred belonging to patricians
could have been known to him. By no means the weakest argument
in favor of the view here presented is the fact that the laws
of the Twelve Tables concerning inheritance, tutelage,<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> etc.—which
apply not to the patricians alone but to the whole citizen
body—assume that every citizen in full possession of his civil
rights belonged to a gens.</p>

<p>A passage often interpreted against the existence of plebeian
gentes is Livy x. 8. 9: “Vos solos gentem habere.” In this
case a plebeian speaker says the patricians claim that they alone
have gens (not gentes). The context shows clearly, however,
that gens does not here denote an association but is used in the
sense of illustrious birth or pedigree,<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> as is sometimes our word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
family.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Wherever a nobility exists it necessarily lays greater
stress on descent than do the people, and in all countries the
nobles are in a far better position to keep up family connections
than are the commons. Naturally therefore at Rome we hear
more of patrician than of plebeian gentes. But in view of all
the facts mentioned above there should be no doubt as to the
existence of the latter. The result of this discussion is that
neither in the composition of the gens nor in its position in the
community can support be found for Niebuhr’s assumption of a
patrician state.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>Other evidence for his hypothesis Niebuhr thinks he finds in
a statement of Labeo,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> that the curiate assembly was convoked
by a lictor, the centuriate by a horn-blower; while Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
says that the patricians were summoned by name through a
messenger, the people by the blowing of a horn. Thus Niebuhr
maintains that Labeo and Dionysius agree unequivocally in
designating the curiae as the assembly of the patricians. But
in fact these two sources refer to the customs of the historical
age, when the curiate assembly was ordinarily attended by only
three augurs and thirty lictors. Horn-blowing under these
circumstances would have been absurd. The summoning of
the patricians by their own name and that of their father, on
the other hand, proves them too few to compose a popular
assembly. These citations therefore are far from supporting
his hypothesis. His last and greatest proof is the identification
of the lex de imperio, passed by the curiae, with the patrum
auctoritas. If these are merely two terms for the same act, the
curiae must have been made up of patres. But by establishing
the fact that the patrum auctoritas belonged to the senate or
to its patrician members, Willems<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> have
deprived Niebuhr’s hypothesis of its main prop.</p>

<p>Niebuhr evidently believed that the curiae continued exclusively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
patrician through the whole republican period.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> This
idea, however, must be dismissed for the following reasons:
(1) Our sources agree that in the early republic the plebeians
and clients continued to vote in the curiate assembly.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
(2) The plebeians were in the curiae in 208 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when the
first curio maximus was chosen from the plebs.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> (3) In the time
of Cicero thirty plebeian<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> lictors represented the comitia curiata,
and gave the votes.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> (4) Arrogations by plebeians took
place in this assembly; in the well-known case of Clodius
it must be borne in mind that it was a plebeian who arrogated
him. (5) The extinction of the patriciate did not involve
the downfall of the comitia curiata.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> (6) The confirmation
by the curiae (lex de imperio) of elections in the centuriate
assembly was conceived as a second vote of the community.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
(7) The resolutions of the comitia curiata are always thought
of as resolutions of the populus, which Latin literature nowhere
restricts to the patrician body. (8) In all ancient literature
there is nowhere the slightest hint of a change in the social
composition of the curiae or of the comitia curiata in the whole
course of their history. What the ancients believed to be true
of either institution at any particular period will hold therefore
for its entire history.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Of the arguments in favor of Niebuhr’s hypothesis either
added by Schwegler<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> or brought by him into greater prominence,
one only demands attention. He reasons that if the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
plebs were in the curiate assembly, it would be impossible to
explain the political advance made by the institution of the
comitia centuriata; and the constitutional history of Rome
would be reduced to an insoluble riddle. Here we have to deal
with a subjective argument—the rejection of sources because
they do not agree with a preconceived theory. Arguments of
the kind, however, which may be easily invented for the support
or overthrow of every imaginable proposition, carry little
weight. Besides it is easy to show by analogies from the history
of other peoples that the presence of the commons in the
primitive assembly does not make the constitutional history of
Rome a real enigma. In the primitive German assembly, for
instance, were included all the warriors; and yet in the more
developed German states were monarchies and aristocracies
which gave the people little or no voice in the management of
public affairs.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> The Homeric Greek assembly included all freemen,
who, however, had little to do with the government in
that period, and still less under the aristocracy which followed.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
In like manner, although the plebeians attended the comitia
curiata and had a majority of votes in this assembly, they could
not thereby control the government, for they absolutely lacked
initiative.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> The comitia centuriata, a timocratic institution,
elevated the rich and degraded the poor. Here as elsewhere
the poor lost by the substitution of aristocracy for kingship;
but a real constitutional advance was made in the gradations of
privilege, which were based on wealth and which reached like a
ladder from the humblest member of the proletarian century to
the patrician knight in the sex suffragia.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> These gradations
prepared the way for an ultimate equalization of rights. We
conclude, then, that the presence of the commons in the primitive
assembly is perfectly compatible with a rational view of constitutional
development.</p>

<p>With Schwegler, who grants however reluctantly that the
commons were received into the curiae before 208,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> the
theory enters upon its present phase; for the great majority
of writers since his time have accepted his view, yet with
varying opinions as to the date of the change. Mommsen,<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
who more than any one else has made it clear that, so far
back as our sources reach, the populus comprised both patricians
and commons, nevertheless assumes that the latter were
originally outside the populus but were admitted no later than
the beginning of the republic.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> In his reconstruction of the primitive
state he supposes that the citizens were all patres, in so far
as they, and they alone, could be fathers; or adjectively patricii,
in so far as they, and they alone, had fathers.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Added to
the citizens and their slaves was a class of persons termed clients,
half way between freedom and slavery—a class made up
from various origins but chiefly by the conquest of neighbors.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
These clients belonged, as dependents of the gentes, to the
curiae, but had no vote in the assembly.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Later the plebs were
formed from the clients as the bond which united the latter with
their patrons relaxed.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> The plebs, who were free citizens of
inferior rank, came into being at the moment when the patricio-plebeian
comitia centuriata acquired the right to express the
will of the community.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Although Mommsen knows well the weakness of the evidence
offered by earlier writers, he adopts the hypothesis of an original
patrician state, without attempting a systematic defence.
Here and there in his works, however, he mentions some fact or
condition which he would like to have considered proof. The
following are the chief passages of this kind:</p>

<p>(1) The lack of right to the auspicia<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and to the imperium<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
on the part of the plebeians proves that the patriciate was the
original citizenship.</p>

<p>But we could as reasonably say, with reference to the auspices,
that the two Attic gentes which furnished the sacred exegetes
contained the only Athenian citizens.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> The auspicia, as Soltau<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
has noticed, belonged to the ius honorum, as did also the imperium;
hence they were both privileges of the nobility. In
brief Mommsen’s reasoning would make a governing nobility
everywhere impossible.</p>

<p>(2) The cavalry were patrician; therefore the infantry must
have been.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>With the same kind of reasoning we could conclude that because
in the Homeric age of Greece chariots were used in war
by nobles only, the infantry must also have been exclusively
noble; whereas we know that the rank and file were common
men.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> That the Roman army before Servius was similarly composed
is supported not only by this and many other analogies,
but also by the unanimous testimony of the sources. As in
other primitive states the warriors belonged to the assembly
and were the citizens.</p>

<p>(3) Of the sixteen local tribes named after gentes it can be
proved that ten have the names of patrician gentes, and not one
name is known to be plebeian. This is evident proof that from
the beginning the patriciate was not nobility but citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>His premises prove no more than that at the time when these
tribes were instituted the patricians were influential enough to
give their names to ten, probably to all sixteen. In all the
three cases mentioned, Mommsen reasons that because the patricians
alone enjoyed the honors, privileges, and influence usually
considered appropriate to a nobility, they must therefore
have constituted not the nobility simply but the whole citizen
body.</p>

<p>(4) He identifies patres with gentiles and assumes that the
primitive state was an aggregate of gentes, thus making the
patres the only members of the state.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>These are not proofs but unsupported assumptions. The only
connection of patres with gentes given in Latin literature is in
the well-known phrases patres maiorum and minorum gentium;
and Cicero<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> makes it clear that these patres were senators.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
The phrase means senators from, or belonging to, the greater
or lesser gentes. Furthermore it has been proved (1) that the
patricians were not the only gentiles,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> (2) that the curia, and
hence the state, was not an aggregation of gentes.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>(5) We are informed, says Mommsen, (a) that the body of
full Roman citizens consisted originally of a hundred families,
whose fathers, the patres, regarded more or less concretely as
the ancestors of the individual gentes, composed the senate, and
together with them their descendants, the patricians, made up
the citizen body; or expressed in other words (b) patrician
originally meant just what was afterward included under the
term ingenuus.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>For (a) Mommsen cites those passages by which it has been
shown<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> that the Romans looked upon the original hundred
senators as the fathers neither of the “citizen body” nor of the
“full citizens,” but of the nobility. His statement of the case
is directly contradicted by the authorities he quotes. As regards
(b) it has been sufficiently proved<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> that ingenuus when
made equivalent to patricius most naturally signifies not “of
free birth,” but “of respectable, noble birth.”</p>

<p>Most scholars have wisely avoided bringing the myth of the
asylum<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> into the argument. Pellegrino,<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> however, identifies the
refugees at that place with the entire plebeian body. As the
asylum was not an Italian but a Greek institution,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> the story
connected with it is doubtless a myth. It seems to have been
invented by the Greeks of southern Italy, most probably in the
fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> At that time they began to view with alarm
the southward advance of the Romans, and to disparage them
accordingly by falsifications representing their origin as obscure
and disreputable.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Similar calumnies against other peoples were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
concocted by their Greek enemies.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Notwithstanding the fact
that the story had not even a kernel of historical truth the
Romans accepted it with more or less modification<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> and used it
to some extent for partisan objects.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> They could not oppose the
plebs to patricians as foreigners to natives, however, for (1) they
supposed that plebeians as well as patricians participated in
the original settlement of Rome, (2) they derived patrician as
well as plebeian families from foreign sources.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> We are warranted
in concluding that in adopting the Greek myth of the
asylum they looked upon it as a cause of increase in the plebeian
population without finding in it the origin of the plebeian class.</p>

<p>To the theory of an exclusively patrician populus the following
objections may be summarily urged: (1) It is opposed by
the unanimous testimony of the ancient authorities. (2) It
rests upon a wrong explanation of the words patres, patricii, as
designations of the nobles. (3) It is further propped up by
reasons so feeble as to testify at once to its weakness, the more
substantial basis having been overthrown partly by Mommsen
himself. (4) The number of patricians is too small for the
theory.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> (5) It ignores the meaning of the word plebs, which
evidently signifies “the masses,” in contrast with the few nobles,
and hence could not apply to a class gradually formed by the
liberation of clients, or by the admission of foreigners. No
one who holds the theory has attempted to show what these
liberated clients were called when they were but few compared
with the patricians—before they became “the multitude.”
(6) It is contradicted by everything we know of Rome’s attitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
towards aliens. So far back as our knowledge reaches, she was
extremely liberal in bestowing the citizenship, even forcing it
upon some communities. Only when she acquired the rule
over a considerable part of Italy did she begin to show illiberality
in this respect. Down to 353 the citizenship thus freely
extended included the right to vote.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> (7) It assumes the existence
of a community politically far advanced yet showing no
inequalities of rank among the freemen—a condition outside
the range of human experience. It aims to explain the origin
of the social classes on purely Roman ground, ignoring the fact
that distinctions of rank are far older than the city, and exist, at
least in germ, in the most primitive communities of which we
have knowledge.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<h4>III. <i>The Comparative-Sociological View</i></h4>

<p>As social classes belong to all society,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> they cannot be explained
by the peculiar conditions of any one community. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
only scientific approach to this subject is through comparative
study; the inferences of the ancient historians relative to
primitive Rome are not to be displaced by purely subjective
theories, but are to be tested by comparison with conditions in
other communities of equal or less cultural advancement.</p>

<p>Distinctions of rank depend ultimately upon physical, mental,
and moral inequalities,<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> which differentiate the population of a
community into leaders and followers.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The exhibition of
physical strength and skill on the part of young men and of
knowledge and wisdom on the part of the elders are often “the
foundation of leadership and of that useful subordination in
mutual aid which depends on voluntary deference.”<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> In an
age in which men were largely under the control of religion the
possession of an oracle or skill in divination or prophecy might
contribute as much to the elevation of an individual above
his fellows.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Leadership, once obtained, could display and
strengthen itself in various ways. In primitive society the
strong, brave, intelligent man was especially qualified to take
command in war. Success brought the chief not only renown
but a large share of the booty and in later time acquired land.
The same result might be obtained by other means than by
war;<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> but in any case wealth and influence inherited through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
several generations made nobility.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Primarily grounded on
ability, wealth, and renown, this preëminence was often heightened
by a claim to divine lineage or other close connection with
the gods.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>There was evidently a stage of development—before the
association of the nobles into a class—in which chieftains alone
held preëminence. This condition is common in primitive society,
as among the American Indians.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Also among the Germans,
who had advanced somewhat beyond this stage, each chief
or lord appears to have been noble “less with reference to
other noblemen than with reference to the other free tribesmen
comprised in the same group with himself.”<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> From Brehon
law we infer that the Irish lords were individually heads of
their several groups of kinsmen or of vassals;<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and in Wales
the nobles were a hierarchy of chieftains.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> As soon as leadership
became hereditary there arose noble families, in which the
younger members were often sub-chieftains;<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and finally
through intermarriage among these families, as well as through
the discovery of common interests, the nobles associated themselves
into a class.</p>

<p>Among the ancient Germans,<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> the Greeks of the Homeric<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
age,<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> and in some early Italian states<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> certain families had become
noble, and others were on the way to nobility. For
ancient Ireland the entire process can be followed. A common
freeman enters the service of some chief, from whom he receives
permission to use large portions of the tribe land.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> By pasturing
cattle, he grows wealthy, becomes a bo-aire (cow-nobleman) and
secures a band of dependents. Supported by these followers,
he preys upon his neighbors and, if successful, becomes in time
a powerful noble.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> After “a certain number of generations”
he can no longer be distinguished from the blooded nobility.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
Here is an instance of a common freeman’s becoming noble
through service to a chief. In like manner among the Saxons
who had conquered England the ceorl who “thrived so that he
had fully five hides of land,” or the merchant who had “fared
twice over the wide sea by his own means,” became a thane;
“and if the thane thrived, so that he became an eorl, then was
he henceforth worthy of eorl-right.”<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> “The thanes were the
immediate companions of the king—his comitatus—and from
their first appearance in English history they took rank above
the earlier nobility of Saxon eorls, who were descended from
ancient tribal chiefs. Thus the thanes as a nobility of newly
rich corresponded to the cow-noblemen of an earlier time.”<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> In
the way just described many rose from the lower ranks to
nobility. In fact, eminent authorities assert that the inferior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
nobles, especially of the middle age, were more often of servile
than of free origin, as the common freemen were inclined to
think it degrading to be seen among the comites of a chief.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>It has now been sufficiently established that even in the tribal
condition people were differentiated into social ranks. We have
traced the beginning of nobility to leadership and have found,
in both ancient and mediaeval society, new noble families forming
by the side of the old. Social distinctions were well developed
long before the founding of cities. When a community,
whether a tribe or a city, is far enough advanced to begin the
conquest of neighbors, “it has already differentiated into royal,
noble, free, and servile families.”<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> This was true of Sparta.
In her “the conquerors nevertheless, notwithstanding great differences
among themselves, remain sharply separated in social
function from the conquered.... The conquerors became a
religious, military, and political class, and the conquered an industrial
class.”<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Even in the case of Sparta, however, which is
perhaps our best example of the exclusiveness of a ruling city,
there is evidence of mingling between the conquering Spartans
and the conquered Laconians before the former became exclusive.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
In like manner there was much mixing of the invading
“Aryans” with the natives of India—the more intelligent of
the natives rising to the higher classes and the less gifted of
the invaders sinking to the lower—before the crystallization
of the castes.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> We find the same mingling of conquerors and
conquered in varying degrees in ancient Ireland,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> in England
under the Normans,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> and throughout the Roman empire in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
period of Germanic settlements.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> It becomes doubtful, therefore,
whether a nobility was ever formed purely by the superposition
of one community upon another. The effect of conquest
was rather to accentuate existing class distinctions, and by a
partial substitution of strangers in place of native nobles to stir
up antagonism between the classes. Even where the differences
between the social ranks seem to be racial, it would be hazardous
to resort to the race theory in explanation; for such a condition
could be produced in the course of generations by
different modes of life, education, nurture, and marriage regulations
of the nobles and commons respectively.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>The study pursued thus far will enable us to understand how
there came to be social classes at Rome before the beginning of
conquest. But for a long time after the Romans began to annex
territory we may seek in vain for a distinction between conquerors
and conquered, like that which we find in Laconia. We are
forbidden to identify the plebs with the conquered and the patricians
with the conquerors by many considerations mentioned
above—for instance, by tradition,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> by the derivation of several
patrician gentes from various foreign states,<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> by the fewness of
the patricians,<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> and by the fact that the latter show no differentiations
of rank, such as we find among the conquering Spartans;
they were not a folk but a nobility pure and simple. We are
to regard Rome’s early annexations of territory and of populations
not as subjugations, but as incorporations on terms of
equality. The people incorporated were of the same great
folk, the Latins, or of a closely related folk, the Sabines.
Accordingly they were not reduced to subjection, but were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
admitted to citizenship, to the tribes and the curiae, and their
nobles were granted the patriciate.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Only communities of alien
speech, like the Etruscan, or distant Italian communities like
the Campanian, were ordinarily given the inferior civitas sine
suffragio; and this restricted citizenship does not appear in
history before the middle of the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The analogies offered in this chapter, by proving that the
conditions they illustrate are possible for early Rome, tend to
confirm the authority of the sources. By similar comparative
study it would be practicable to illustrate in detail and to corroborate
the statements of ancient writers as to the organization of
the plebs, as well as of the patricians, in tribes and curiae, the
participation of the clients and plebeians in war and politics, and
the deterioration of the free commons through the strengthening
of the nobility—all of which are rejected by eminent modern
historians, who merely imagine them incompatible with primitive
conditions or with a rational theory of constitutional development.
The inquiry has been pursued far enough, however, to indicate
that from a comparative-sociological point of view the conception<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
of early Rome handed down to us by the ancients is sound and
consistent, and that the method of subjective reconstruction of
history introduced by Niebuhr and still extensively employed by
scholars is unscientific.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE THIRTY-FIVE TRIBES</span></h3>

</div>

<p>That among the Romans the conception of property first
attached to movable objects is attested by the words “pecunia”
and “mancipatio.”<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> There was probably a period during which
the citizens cultivated the lots of arable land assigned them by
the state without regarding these holdings as property either
public or private. In view of the well-established fact that the
gens was a relatively late institution, we should for this remote
period exclude the idea of gentile tenure.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> The land was distributed
among the families according to tribes and curiae; and
when the idea of ownership extended to the soil, it took the
form of family ownership of the ager privatus and state ownership
of the public domain.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>The condition of tenure anterior to the conception of property
in land left little trace of itself in the language and institutions
and absolutely none in tradition. The sources declare that family<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
ownership existed in Rome from her foundation as well as in her
earliest colonies—a view confirmed by the comparative study
of language.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Each family, they assume, held two iugera—the
heredium<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>—or we may more correctly say, at least two iugera.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
This small lot has generally been explained<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> as the private
landed property of the individual, in contrast with the public
land and with the common land of the gens, and thus it is taken
as evidence of a condition prior to the extension of private
ownership to the arable fields. Should we grant this to be the
true explanation, we might still assume that public and gentile
tenure had developed into private ownership of arable land
long before Servius, or that Servius himself converted the fields
into private holdings. For the second alternative we could find
apparent support in the sources, which have much to say of the
distribution of land among the citizens by Servius.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> For the
continued absence of private ownership after the Servian reforms
not even the shadow of an authority can be found.</p>

<p>But the explanation of heredium given above is by no means
necessary; in fact the sources regard it not as the only private
land, but rather as the smallest share allotted to any citizen, the
rich and noble possessing more.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> While accordingly the wealthy
man owned many iugera, the poor man, limited to his heredium,
was obliged to earn part of his living by labor as a tenant or as
a wage-earner in the field of his rich neighbor;<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> and in the early
colonies the bina iugera were granted on the same aristocratic
principle. If this is the true explanation of heredium, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
strongest argument in support of the theory of public ownership
at Rome in the late regal period is taken away; we must either
abandon the theory or relegate it to a time far anterior to the
Servian reforms. Mommsen’s assumption<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> that the sixteen oldest
rural tribes were instituted some time after the city tribes by
the division of gentile lands is untenable on other grounds. The
gens which gave its name to the tribe could not have owned all
the land in the tribe; for in that case all but the sixteen gentes
would have been landless. Again, assuming, as he does, that
all the land belonged to the gentes, which he supposes to have
been exclusively patrician, we should be forced to conclude that
the division left the plebeians landless. And further, if we bear
in mind that the gens developed from the family, we must also
believe that the undivided gentile land was once a family estate,
which according to Roman usage had to be registered in some
tribe, even if the land of the gens was not so registered.
Mommsen’s theory proves therefore not only to be unsupported
by the sources but actually unthinkable. In conclusion we may
safely say that though some land remained public, and though
the gens after it had come into existence owned some common
land, individual, or at most family,<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> ownership was in full force
in the earliest times of which we have knowledge.</p>

<p>The clearest and most detailed account of the origin of the
Servian tribes is given by Dionysius iv. 14. 1 f.: “When Tullius
had surrounded the seven hills with one wall, he divided the
city into four parts, and giving to the parts the names of the
hills—to one Palatina, to another Suburana, to the third
Collina, and to the fourth Esquilina—he made the city to consist
of four tribes, whereas up to that time it had comprised but
three.... And he ordained that the men who lived in each
of the four parts should not change their abode or give in their
census elsewhere. The enlistment of soldiers also and the collection
of taxes, which they were to pay individually to the
treasury for military and other purposes, were distributed no
longer among the three gentile tribes but among the four local
tribes instituted by him.... [15. 1:] And the whole country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
he divided, as Fabius says,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> into twenty-six parts, also called
tribes, adding to them the four city tribes; but Venonius is
authority for thirty-one rural tribes, which with those of the
city would complete the thirty-five of our own time. Cato,
however, who is more trustworthy than either of these two,
says that all the tribes in the time of Tullius amounted to thirty,
though he does not separate the number of parts” (into urban
and rural).</p>

<p>A great variety of opinion has arisen regarding the original
number of the Servian tribes. Niebuhr<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> believed that Servius
created in all thirty, afterward reduced by unfortunate war with
the Etruscans to twenty. This view found supporters but was
refuted by Huschke.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Those who rejected it generally agreed
that Servius divided the city into four tribes and the country
into districts, regiones, pagi.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> gave a new phase to
the theory of the subject by assuming that the four so-called
city tribes, which all the sources agree in ascribing to Servius,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
included the country as well as the city. According to this
hypothesis Alba<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and Ostia,<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> for instance, belonged to the
Palatine tribe. His opinion has found wide acceptance.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
Afterward changing his mind, he asserted that the four urban
tribes were confined within the pomerium—a view which now
seems to be established beyond doubt.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> With this final position
of Mommsen the creation of theories as to the number and
limitations of the Servian tribes has not been exhausted; for
against the view that Servius instituted only the four urban
tribes may be placed that of Pais,<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> who assigns their origin to
the censors of the year 304. The theory of Pais implies that
the sixteen rural tribes which bore gentile names were far older
than the four urban tribes.</p>

<p>Light will be thrown on this obscure subject by an inquiry
into the relation of the sources to one another. It seems
certain that Fabius derived his information concerning the tribes
and the entire centuriate organization from the “discriptio centuriarum”—a
document in the censors’ office. Though ascribed
to Servius Tullius as author,<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> it set forth the centuriate
system as it existed in reality before the reform—that is in
the time of the first war with Carthage.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> It was this late
form of the centuriate organization which Fabius had in mind.
He must have been prevented, however, from ascribing to
Servius the institution of all the thirty-three tribes then existing,
by the recollection that two tribes were added as recently
as 299 from territory too far from Rome to have formed a part
of her domain under Servius; and perhaps the curiate organization
led him to favor the number thirty. He made Servius the
author of thirty tribes, accordingly, in spite of the fact that this
number was not reached till 318. His error is not more absurd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
than the ascription to Servius of the whole centuriate organization
as it stood at the opening of the First Punic War, or
the assumption that in the first Servian census were enrolled
eighty thousand men fit for military service.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Cato, who also
states the original number as thirty, without separating them
into rural and urban,<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> may have been influenced by Fabius,
though it is likely that he drew from the same source. Vennonius
in making Servius the author of all thirty-five tribes but
slightly exceeds the absurdity of earlier writers.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Evidently
Fabius and Cato were the sources for all future annalists.
While depending on them, Varro seems to have noticed the
error of ascribing twenty-six rural tribes to Servius, as there
were but seventeen of this class before 387. To avoid the difficulty
and at the same time to retain the Fabian number, he
supposed that the country districts of Servius were not yet
tribes but the regiones from which the tribes were afterward
formed<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>—a superficial explanation in the true Varronian style.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
Following Varro, however, later authorities generally speak of
the four urban tribes of Servius without mentioning those of
the country.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> So Dionysius, after referring to the four city
tribes, proceeds to describe their character and functions, as
though these were all the tribes then existing.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> Thus far he
depends upon Varro. Fortunately, however, he gained from
Fabius the information that there were also twenty-six rural
tribes, his description of which<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> is slightly troubled by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Varronian notion that these country districts were not so much
tribes as regiones, πάγοι, but which served all the purposes of
tribes including the taking of the census.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>The various contradictory statements of the ancients regarding
the original number of Servian tribes can now be appreciated
at their respective values. In the course of the discussion it
has become evident, too, that Fabius and Cato, the sources of
later annalists, had no tenable ground for their assumption of
thirty original tribes. Had they examined the records, perhaps
the succeeding parts of their own chronicles, they would have
found that before 387 there could have been only twenty-one
tribes in all.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> A less certain indication of the admission of one
or possibly two tribes still earlier in the republic may have
existed;<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> but here we reach the extreme limit of their knowledge.
Any investigation of the number in the regal period,
whether by the ancients or by the moderns, must rest not upon
contemporary records but upon inference pure and simple. We
may inquire, accordingly, whether the view of Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> and
Meyer<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> that the four city tribes were created first and existed
for a time before the institution of the rural tribes, having no
trustworthy foundation in the sources, can be deduced from our
knowledge of the general conditions of the time. We must by
all means avoid the supposition of Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> that in the time
of Servius there was no private property in land outside of the
city.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> If then we bear in mind two points which Mommsen has
himself established, (1) that the local tribe was an aggregate of
private estates,<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> (2) that the four urban tribes of Servius were
limited to the city,<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> we must conclude that in the time of Servius
the country estates were registered in rural tribes—in other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
words that Servius instituted rural as well as urban tribes.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
The view of Meyer that all the citizens lived in the city and
the dependents in the country<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>—which would afford a ground
for assuming the urban tribes to have been earlier than the
rural—has no basis either in institutions or in tradition. If
originally the country was all-important,<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> and if at the dawn
of history we find the country and city politically equal, as is
actually the case, we have no motive for the insertion of an
intermediate stage in which the city was all-important. There
was indeed a tendency toward the concentration of political
power within the city, but it did not advance beyond the equalization
of city and country.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> To maintain Meyer’s view we
should be obliged to complicate the early history of Rome with
two revolutions—one by which the city gained supremacy over
the country, and the other in which the supremacy was lost.
It is mainly to defend the early history of the comitia, and of
the constitution in general, against this complication that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
present discussion of the early land tenure and of the origin
of the Servian tribes is offered.</p>

<p>The original number of tribes, as has been stated, is unknown.
It was increased by the acquisition of territory. Possibly
the annalists found an obscure trace of the admission of
the sixteenth rural tribe—the Claudia—in 504. To that year
Livy assigns the coming of Attius Clausus with his host of
clients, who were formed into the Claudian tribe.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Wissowa<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
suggests that the immigration of the Claudian gens, the date of
which did not appear in the original tradition,<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> was arbitrarily
assigned to the year in which was recorded the admission of the
tribe. This conjecture is supported by the situation of the
Claudia, which would place it among the latest of the twenty.</p>

<p>With more confidence we may assign the admission of the
seventeenth rural tribe—the twenty-first in the entire list—to
495.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> It must have been the Clustumina.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> We are certain that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
there were only twenty-one till 387, when four new tribes were
formed, bringing the number up to twenty-five.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The twenty-sixth
and twenty-seventh were admitted in 358,<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> the twenty-eighth
and twenty-ninth in 332,<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> the thirtieth and thirty-first in
318,<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> the thirty-second and thirty-third in 300<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>, the thirty-fourth
and thirty-fifth in 241.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> To the year 90 that number is
known to have remained unchanged, and the evidence of a
temporary increase during the Social War is obscure. On this
point Appian<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> states that “the Romans did not enroll the
newly admitted citizens in the existing thirty-five tribes for fear
that, being more numerous, they might outvote the old citizens
in the comitia; but by dividing them into ten parts (?) they
made new tribes, in which the new citizens voted last.” This
view of an increase in number is confirmed by a statement of
Sisenna<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> as to the creation of two new tribes at about that
time. Velleius<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> however informs us that the new citizens were
enrolled in eight tribes. In the object of the arrangement he
agrees with Appian. Next he mentions the promise of Cinna
to enroll the Italians in all the tribes. From the connection we
should naturally infer that in the opinion of Velleius the new
citizens were enrolled before Cinna in eight old tribes; and yet
it is difficult to understand how the assembly could be persuaded
to visit any group of rural tribes with this disgrace and political
disability.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> As the authority of Sisenna, if not that of Appian,
compels us to accept the fact of new tribes, it is better to interpret<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
Velleius in that light.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> We may suppose then that the
eight tribes which he mentions were provided for by the Julian
law of 90; and we must accept the statement of Sisenna that
in 89 the Calpurnian law “ex senati consulto” created two
other new tribes, in which were to be enrolled the citizens
admitted under this law. Thus we could account for the ten (?)
new tribes mentioned by Appian. As regards the Lucanians
and the Samnites, who held out obstinately against Rome, the
same historian<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> states that they were respectively enrolled in
tribes, as in the former instances. He does not inform us,
however, that for this purpose other new tribes were instituted.
At all events there seems to be no essential disagreement
among our sources; and we have no reasonable ground for
doubting an increase, though we may remain uncertain as to the
number added.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>The arrangement was only temporary. In 88 Sulpicius,
tribune of the plebs, carried a law containing a provision for
the distribution of the new citizens and the libertini among all
the thirty-five tribes.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> His plebiscite was annulled by the senate
on the ground that it had been passed by violence;<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> but the
provisions contained in it were afterward legalized by a senatus
consultum, and it was finally carried into effect by Cinna
as consul in 84.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> This settlement of the question was approved
by Sulla<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> for all the Italians excepting the Marsians
and the Paelignians, who were enrolled in one tribe—the
Sergia.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>The nature of the tribes may be inferred from their object.
The intention of the organizer was to introduce the Greek
military system, comprising heavy and light infantry, in which
the kind of service to be performed depended upon financial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
ability to provide equipments.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Seeing that a classification of
citizens with respect to property was necessary for this purpose,
Servius instituted the tribes as a basis for the census. That
they contained the ager privatus only is indicated by the exclusion
from them of the Capitoline and Aventine hills.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Their
local character is established by the concurrent testimony of
ancient writers.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Yet even in the beginning they could but
roughly be described as districts, for they excluded all public
land and all waters and waste places claimed neither by individuals
nor by the government. They retained the approximate
character of districts so long only as the territory of annexed
communities continued to be formed into new tribes. The process
came to an end in 241; and it was as early at least as this
date that the Roman colonies, not originally in the tribes, were
incorporated in them.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Thereafter the annexation of new territory
tended more and more to render the tribes geographically indeterminate.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
The process was far advanced by the admission
(90-84) of the Latins and Italians with their lands to the existing
tribes,<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> which were further enlarged in the imperial period
by the incorporation of provincial communities.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> As consisting
of lands, though no longer necessarily adjacent, they were still
considered local.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>The tribe was also a group of persons; in fact the word
applies far more frequently to persons than to territory.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> During<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
the early republic a considerable degree of harmony was maintained
between the two aspects of the institution (1) possibly
by a restriction on the transfer of residence,<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> (2) by the change
in membership from tribe to tribe, through the censors, on the
basis of a transfer of domicile, (3) by the assignment of new
citizens to the tribe in or near which they had their homes,
(4) by the creation of new tribes for new citizens who did not
live in or near the existing tribes. This harmony experienced
its first serious disturbance through the enrolment of the landless,
irrespective of domicile, in the urban tribes in 304,<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> but
continued to such a degree that a hundred years later the
rural voters generally still resided in their own tribes.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> In
the last century of the republic the personal tribe, emancipated
from the local, depended solely on inheritance and the
will of the censors.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>The original composition of the personal tribe is determined
by its purely military object. It comprised accordingly those
only who were liable to service in war. From the early Roman
point of view those citizens were qualified who found their
livelihood in agriculture.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Not all landowners were enrolled in
the tribes; for Latin residents,<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> freedmen,<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> widows and orphans,<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
all of whom might possess land, lacked membership.
Those proprietors, too, were excluded whom the censors assigned
to the aerarii as a punishment. Tribesmen were all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
the other landowners—adsidui<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> et locupletes<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>—together with
the male descendants of military age under their potestas.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>Another object of the tribes, referred to Servius by our
sources, was the collection of taxes.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> We know that they
afterward served this purpose; and the ancient writers, who
could have had no direct knowledge of the intentions of Servius
but who assigned to him without hesitation all the later
developments of his organization, were in this case especially
misled by their false derivation of tributum from tribus or <i>vice
versa</i>.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> A brief study of the facts in the case will prove their
inference to be wrong. The most obvious consideration is that
had Servius intended the tribes for the levy of taxes as well as
for military purposes, he would have included all who were subject
to taxation as well as all who were liable to service in the
army, whereas in fact he admitted those only who were to
serve. It is to be noted that primitive Rome imposed no regular
direct taxes on the citizens in general. Every man equipped
himself for war even after the introduction of the phalanx;<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
doubtless at first the knights provided their own horses;<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> and
in short campaigns the soldiers carried their provisions from
their own farms.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Fortifications and public buildings were
erected by forced task-work. The king supported himself
partly by gifts from his subjects and partly from the public
property, including land.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Other early sources of revenue were
tolls levied for the use of harbors, boundaries, temples, bridges,
roads, sewers, and salt works.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> In time the idea arose, too, that
the person who did not perform military service should help
with his property in the defence of the country. The estates
of widows and orphans were accordingly taxed to support the
horses of the knights.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> Those men, also, who were exempt
from service because they possessed no land<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and yet had other
property were required to pay on it a regular tax. From
this connection with the public treasury (aerarium) they were
termed aerarii. This class comprised shopkeepers and merchants.
Sometimes the censors assigned to it as a punishment
men who owned land. The fact that such persons were
at the same time removed from their tribes is sufficient proof
that the aerarii were originally outside these associations.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
The cives sine suffragio, or Caerites, after this class had come
into existence in 353, were like the aerarii in (1) that they did
not belong to the tribes, (2) that they paid a regular tax, (3) that
men were placed on their list as a punishment. They may
accordingly be regarded as a special class of aerarii, enrolled as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
they were in a distinct list.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Whereas the cives sine suffragio
either wholly lacked the franchise, as the phrase implies, or at
most had but the right of the Latins,<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> the other aerarii must
have voted in the proletarian century.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>The ordinary taxes sufficed for the usual light expenses; but
in case of especial need an extraordinary tax was imposed upon
the citizens. It was called tributum from tribuere, “to apportion,”
because it was distributed among the citizens in proportion
to their ratable property.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> We hear of such a tax levied for
ransoming the city from the Gauls<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> and another for the building
of a wall;<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> but the most common use was for the payment of
soldiers, hence the tributum was thought of primarily as a war
tax.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> For this reason tributum came to be correlative with stipendium.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
It was not often imposed before the introduction of
pay in 406.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Even then it was not levied every year; it was
sometimes refunded when the condition of the treasury permitted;
and it fell into disuse after 167.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> As it was imposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
on those only who were liable to military duty,<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> the tribe lists
were followed in its collection, and in this sense we may say
that it was collected tributim.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The work was done by state
functionaries, as the tribe, so far as we know, had neither fiscal
officers<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> nor a treasury; and possessing no property, it could
not be held financially responsible.</p>

<p>An epoch in the history of the tribes was made in 312 by
Appius Claudius Caecus the censor, who enrolled the landless
citizens, proletarians as well as aerarii, in the existing thirty-three
tribes without discrimination.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Cives sine suffragio were
alone excepted.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> By giving the landless the upper hand in the
assemblies this measure roused the animosity of the proprietors,
and thus endangered the peace of the state. In order to soothe
the excited feelings of the better class, Q. Fabius Rullianus,
censor in 304, supported by his colleague Decius, removed the
landless from the rural tribes; but not to deprive them wholly
of tribal privileges, he registered them in the four urban tribes.
Hence his measure is spoken of as a compromise. Thereafter
the landholding and hence more respectable citizens were
preferably enrolled in the rural tribes,<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> whereas the landless
were confined to those of the city.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> It was a permanent gain
that henceforth tribal membership was a test of perfect citizenship.
The censors still had the power to transfer a man from
one tribe to another, for instance, from a rural to an urban
tribe; but they could not exclude him wholly from the tribes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
for that would be tantamount to depriving him of the citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>
There were still aerarii; individuals and sometimes large
groups of citizens were still assigned as a punishment to this
class, which, however, was henceforth included in the tribes of
the city.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Although the ordinary urban tribesmen were usually
exempt from military duty, the aerarii were required to serve, at
times under especially hard conditions,<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> and were not disqualified
for office.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> In registering them in the tribes Claudius made
them, like the landowners, liable to military service and to the
tributum according to their means. To effect this object he
necessarily assessed their personal property on a money valuation;
and in order to treat all tribesmen alike, he must have
changed the terms of valuation of the landholders’ estates from
iugera to money.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CENTURIES AND THE CLASSES</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The ancient authorities represent Servius Tullius as the
founder of an organization at once military and political—on
the one hand the army composed of classes and centuries,
and on the other the comitia centuriata. According to Livy<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“From those whose rating was 100,000 asses or more he made 80 centuries,
40 of seniors and 40 of juniors, and termed them all the <i>first</i> class. The
seniors were to be ready for guarding the city and the juniors were to serve in
the field. The arms required of them were a helmet, round shield, greaves, and
cuirass,—all bronze,—for the protection of the body. Their offensive weapons
were a spear and a sword. To this class were added two centuries of sappers
who were to serve without arms. Their duty was to convey the engines of
war. The <i>second</i> class was made up of those whose rating was between
75,000 and 100,000 asses, 20 centuries of seniors and juniors together. They
were equipped with an oblong shield (scutum) instead of a round one, and
they lacked the cuirass, but in all other respects their arms were the same.
The minimal rating of the <i>third</i> class was 50,000 asses, and the number of centuries
was the same with the same distinction of age, and there was no change
in arms excepting that greaves were not required. In the <i>fourth</i> were
those appraised at 25,000 asses. They had the same number of centuries
but their arms were changed, nothing being assigned them but a spear and
a long javelin. The <i>fifth</i> class was larger, composed of 30 centuries. They
carried slings and stones for throwing. Among them were counted the
accensi, the hornblowers, and the trumpeters, 3 centuries. This class was
appraised at 11,000 asses. Those whose rating was less formed one century
exempt from military service. Having thus armed and organized the infantry,
he levied 12 centuries of equites from among the chief men of the state.
Also the 3 centuries instituted by Romulus he made into 6 others of the same
names as those under which the three had originally been inaugurated.”
Afterward Livy speaks of the votes of the centuries in the comitia.</p>

</div>

<p>The ultimate source of this description, as well as of the
similar account given by Dionysius, is the censorial document
already mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> sometimes termed the “discriptio<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
centuriarum,”<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> sometimes “Commentarii Servi Tullii”<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> on the
supposition that Servius was the author. In reality it belonged
to the Censoriae Tabulae<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> of the period immediately following
269.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> The document gave a list of the classes, centuries, and
ratings, and furnished directions for holding the centuriate
assembly. As the military divisions and equipments mentioned
by Livy in the passage above had been discarded long before
this date,<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> they could not have been described in the document.
The account of them found in our sources must, therefore,
have been supplied by antiquarian study.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> The annalist
who first used these Tabulae in the censorial archives was
Fabius Pictor.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Whether Livy and Dionysius derived their
account directly from him or through a later annalist cannot
be determined.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Though Cicero’s source may ultimately have
been the same, he seems to have depended largely on his memory
and is chronologically, though not in substance, less exact.
In assigning seventy rather than eighty centuries to the first
class he most probably has in mind a stage of transition from
the earlier to the reformed organization.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>A brief analysis of this description, as presented by Livy or
Dionysius, will prove that it could not apply at the same time to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
an army and a political assembly: (1) The century of proletarians,
which formed a part of the comitia, and which according
to Dionysius was larger than all the rest together, was exempt
from military service.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> (2) The unarmed supernumeraries
termed accensi velati must in their military function have lacked
the centuriate organization, as will hereafter be made clear.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
(3) The musicians and the skilled workmen who accompanied
the army must also be eliminated from the centuriate organization
of the army.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> (4) The seniors, too, lacked the centuriate
military organization.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> (5) Thus the only pedites in the original
centuriate system were the juniors. Even the military century
of juniors was not in the beginning strictly identical with a voting
century; and as time progressed, the one group diverged
more and more widely from the other.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>Chiefly from these facts, which will become clear in the course
of this study, we are warranted in concluding that the army was
at no time identical with the comitia centuriata. As one was
necessarily an outgrowth of the other, the military organization
must have been the earlier. If therefore the original form of
the centuriate system is to be referred to Servius Tullius, he
will be considered the organizer of the phalanx, which the military
centuries constituted,<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> not of the comitia.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> This result
harmonizes with the view of the ancient writers that the comitia
centuriata exercised no functions—hence we have a right to
infer that it had no existence—before the beginning of the
republic.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>The following sketch of the development of the Roman military
system from the earliest times to the institution of the
manipular legion includes those features only which are essential
to an understanding of the origin and early character of the
centuriate assembly. The view maintained in this volume is,
as suggested in the preceding paragraph, that the comitia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
centuriata in the form described by Livy and Dionysius developed
from the early republican military organization, which
was itself the result of a gradual growth. Reference is made
to equipments chiefly for the purpose of throwing light on the
relation of the Roman to the Greek organization and of the
various Roman military divisions to one another.</p>

<h4>I. <i>The Primitive Graeco-Italic Army and the Origin of the
Phalanx</i></h4>

<p>Recent research has brought to light a period of Italian
history during which the military system of the Latins and
Etruscans closely resembled that of the Mycenaeans, the former
doubtless being derived in large part from the latter.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> The
nobleman,<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> equipped in heavy armor, rode forth in his chariot<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
to challenge his peer among the enemy to personal combat.
The mass of common footmen were probably grouped in tribes
and curiae (Greek phratries, brotherhoods),<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> as in Homeric<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
Greece<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> and among the early Europeans<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> before the development
of an organization based on a numerical system. The
arms of the footmen must have been lighter, and probably varied
with the individual’s financial resources. These common troops
could have had no special training or discipline, as they counted
for little in war.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> Yet in the Homeric age of Greece some attempt
was made to keep the fighters in line, and to prevent the
champions from advancing beyond it to single combat.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> A similar
tendency to even, rhythmic movement may be inferred for
the Latin army.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> The great innovators in this direction were
the Lacedaemonians, to whom the honor of inventing the
phalanx is chiefly due.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> This improvement, which made an
epoch in European warfare, could not have been later than the
eighth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The phalanx was a line, several ranks
deep, of heavy-armed warriors, who moved as a unit to the
sound of music.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> The depth varied as the occasion demanded;
it was not necessarily uniform throughout the line, but for
Lacedaemon eight may be considered normal.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> The heavy-armed
trooper carried a large shield, which covered the entire body, a
helmet, and greaves; his offensive weapons were sword and
spear.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> Tyrtaeus mentions also a coat of mail though not as
an essential part of the equipment.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> The metal of their defensive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
armor was mostly bronze; their swords and spear-points
were probably iron, which the mines of Laconia abundantly
supplied.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Although it is well known that the phalanx was
composed of smaller units, the original organization can only be
conjectured. It is not unlikely that in the beginning there were
tribal regiments,<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> divided into companies of fifty or perhaps a
hundred,<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> which were made up of still smaller groups. The
military age extended from the twentieth to the sixtieth year.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>The phalanx was readily adopted by other Greek states,
which modified it to suit their several conditions. In Athens
and probably elsewhere the army had a tribal organization,<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> but
a census was introduced in order to determine who possessed
sufficient wealth for service on horseback, in the heavy infantry,
and in the light infantry; and when once the census classes
were adopted, it was easy to extend them to political uses. In
this way the four property classes at Athens, probably instituted
about the middle of the seventh century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> became under
Solon if not earlier a basis for the distribution of offices and
other political privileges. Naturally the Greeks of Sicily and
Italy adopted the phalanx, and it is reasonable to suppose that
the Romans derived it, through the Etruscans,<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> from one of
these neighbors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<h4>II. <i>The Servian Army</i></h4>

<p>As the heavy troops of the Greek line were all armed alike,
the Romans probably at first composed their phalanx in a similar
way, without gradations of equipment. The complex system
of census groupings in the army as we find it immediately
before the institution of the manipular legion could only have
resulted from a long development. The statement last made
finds justification in the fact that the term classis<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> was originally
limited to the first or highest census group, all the rest being
“infra classem.”<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>Not only was the organization like that of the Greeks, but
the arms, too, were in the main Greek. The soldiers of the
classis were equipped with helmet, shield, greaves, spear, and
sword; as they wore a cuirass, they used a large round Etruscan
buckler<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> instead of the man-covering Dorian shield. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
were grouped in centuries,<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> forty of which composed the classis
in the fully developed phalanx.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> The age of service of the
juniors, who alone fought in the field, extended from the completed
seventeenth to the completed forty-sixth year,<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> whereas
the seniors from the forty-seventh to the sixtieth year formed a
reserve.</p>

<p>A still nearer connection can be found between the Roman
and the Greek horsemen. As is proved by archaeology, the
earliest Greek knights had no specialized weapons or armor
and were not accustomed to fight on horseback, but were heavy
infantry who used their horses simply as conveyance.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> The
same is true of the earliest Roman equites, whose equipment
closely resembled that of the Greek horsemen. On account of
their swiftness they were primitively called celeres.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Although
these mounted footmen are generally known as equites, which
in this sense may but loosely be translated knights, the Romans
did not institute a true cavalry till the period of the Samnite
wars.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> It is a curious fact that some horsemen, Roman as well
as Greek, were provided each with two horses,<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> one for the
warrior and the other for his squire,<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> and that the mounted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
soldiers of Etruria were in these respects the same.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> A further
resemblance between the earliest Greek and Roman horsemen
lies in the fact that they were noble.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>In their account of the growth of the mounted service during
the regal period the ancient authorities show great inconsistencies.
It seems probable that the early annalists pictured the
increase in the knights in a way analogous to that of the senate:
at first Romulus formed a troop, or century, from the Ramnes;
afterward a second was added from the Tities; and still later
the Luceres furnished a third.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Then Tarquinius Priscus
doubled the number, making six in all, and Servius finally increased
it to eighteen centuries. This simple development,
itself a reconstruction, was complicated by the desire of the
historians to make the number of knights under Servius agree
with the number under Augustus, given by Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> at about
5000; hence the assumption of 200 or even 300 knights to the
century as early as the reign of Romulus.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> It is possible by
clearing away these evident misconceptions to discover the
approximate truth.</p>

<p>When the chariot gave way to the horseback rider is not
definitely known; at all events the change seems to have taken
place under Hellenic influence, and could hardly therefore have
been earlier than the beginning of the seventh century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
The idea of the sources is that there came to be three troops
of horsemen, furnished by the tribes,<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> as well as three regiments
of foot, that before Servius the number of troops of horse was
doubled, and that the six troops thus formed were named accordingly
after the tribes Ramnenses, Titienses, and Lucerenses
priores and posteriores respectively.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> The priores had each
two horses, the posteriores one.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Hence the essential difference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
between these divisions was in rank and wealth rather than in
the relative time of their institution. Long after Servius both
divisions continued to be patrician.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> As the centuriate organization
of Servius applied to the infantry, the cavalry remained
little affected by it. The six troops with their old names survived,
and eventually became a part of the comitia centuriata.
In the military sphere, however, the troop no longer retained
its identity; but the whole body was divided into twenty turmae,
each composed of three decuries commanded by decurions.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
When with the institution of the republic the phalanx was
split into two legions, ten turmae of cavalry were assigned to
each legion.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> As in historical time the number of horsemen to
a legion did not exceed 300,<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> and as we have no reason to suppose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
that at an earlier period this arm of the service was
proportionally stronger, we may conclude that in the Servian
phalanx, or double legion, the number did not exceed 600.</p>

<p>From the foregoing discussion it appears clear that the Servian
military system rested upon a division of the citizens into
four groups, closely corresponding to the Athenian census
divisions: (1) the equites priores, like the pentacosiomedimni,
(2) the equites posteriores, like the hippeis,<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> (3) the classis, like
the zeugitae, (4) the light troops infra classem, like the thetes.
The distinction between priores and posteriores rested not upon
an assessment but upon a less precise difference in wealth,
whether determined by the individual concerned or by the
state we cannot know; it represented, too, a gradation of
nobility. The distinction between the knights and the classici
was one of rank; that between the classis and the soldiers infra
classem was alone determined by the census.</p>

<h4>III. <i>The Development of the Five Post-Servian Military
Divisions on the Basis of Census Ratings</i></h4>

<p>This arrangement was by no means final. Further changes
were made in both foot and horse which were to have a bearing
on the organization of the comitia centuriata. After a time<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
two additions of men less heavily armed than the classici were
made to the phalanx, whether simultaneously or successively
cannot be determined. There were now forty centuries of
classici, and the additions comprised ten centuries each, the
second less heavily armed than the first, though they may both
be considered heavy in contrast with the light troops. Perhaps
the state according to its ability made up the deficiency in the
equipment, so as to render the entire phalanx as evenly armed
as possible.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> It numbered sixty centuries of heavy infantry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
composed of three grades which depended upon the census
rating.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> The light troops were also grouped in two divisions
on the same principle. The first comprised ten centuries;
originally the second may have contained the same number, in
which case four were afterward added to make the fourteen
known to exist in the fully developed system.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> There were five
divisions of infantry amounting to eighty-four centuries of a
hundred men each. Undoubtedly the growth of the army to
this degree of strength was gradual, though the successive steps
cannot be more minutely traced.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>In making the levy the military tribunes selected the soldiers
from the lists of tribesmen, taking one tribe after another as the
lot determined.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> The early Romans must have striven to distribute
the population as equally as possible among the tribes in
order to render them approximately equal in capacity for military
service. As long as this equality continued, the officials
could constitute the army of an equal number of men from each
tribe. These considerations explain the close relation in early
time between the number of tribes and of centuries as well as
the suggestions offered by our sources as to an early connection
between the centuries and the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> While there were but
twenty tribes we may suppose that the legion comprised but
4000 men, which was raised to 4200 when the twenty-first tribe
was added. In this way can we account for the number of
centuries to the legion. If but half the available military
strength was required, the magistrates might draw by lot ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
tribes from which to make the levy.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> It was an easy matter as
long as the heavy troops were limited to the classis;<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> but when
two other ratings were added, and when meantime the tribes
must have grown unlike in population, it became practically
impossible to maintain for each rating a just proportion from
the tribes;<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> and perhaps this was the chief reason for the
modification in the method of recruiting. When therefore the
tribes were increased to twenty-five, and it was deemed inexpedient
to make a corresponding enlargement of the legion,<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> a
new principle was adopted for the levy: after determining the
ratio between the number of men needed and the whole number
available, the officers drew from each tribe a number proportionate
to its capacity.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> It would agree well with all the known
facts to suppose that the addition of the second and third
ratings, followed by a more thorough organization of the light
troops, belongs to the early republic (509-387),<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> when Rome
needed all her strength in her life and death struggle with
hostile neighbors. At the same time the purchase of armor
and the increased burden of military duty would help account<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
for the desperate economic condition of the poorer peasants of
that epoch.</p>

<p>The proportions of the five ratings—20-15-10-5-2½ or 2—to
be discussed hereafter,<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> suggest an explanation of their origin.
It would be reasonable to assume that the normal holding of the
well-to-do citizen was a twenty-iugera lot and that the Servian
phalanx was composed of possessors of that amount, the light-armed
being their sons and others distinctly inferior in wealth.
In course of a few generations as the population grew, with no
corresponding territorial expansion or colonization or industrial
development, and with only a limited conversion of waste to
arable land, many of the lots became divided and subdivided.
The result was a weakening of the phalanx at a time when the
state was in the most pressing need of military resources. The
institution of the five ratings as a basis for the reorganization
of the army was a temporary expedient for meeting the crisis,
to be superseded not long afterward by a better system founded
on military pay. In all probability the introduction of the five
ratings, or at least the beginning of the movement in that direction,
should be closely connected with the institution of the
censorship in 443 or 435.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> The supposition would give us a
sufficient reason for the creation of this new office at that time,
and the strengthening of the army would explain the success of
the Romans in the wars immediately following.</p>

<p>How the five ratings were arrayed in battle is unknown. If
the front counted a thousand men (milites),<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> the classis comprised
four ranks (4000), the second and third ratings one rank
each, making in all six ranks of heavy troops (6000).<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Twenty
centuries could be drawn from the two ratings of light troops
to complete the eight ranks when needed.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> But the Romans<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
undoubtedly exercised the same good judgment as the Lacedaemonians
in varying their formation to suit the emergency;<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
and for that reason it is wrong to assume the same depth
for all occasions or an even depth for any one occasion.
The management of long lines one-man deep must have been
extremely difficult, if not impossible.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> The explanation already
suggested, that the state supplied the deficiency in equipment,<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
would greatly simplify the case, for there would then exist no
need of arraying the census groups in successive lines. Whatever
may have been the tactic arrangement, it did not continue
long, for soon after the introduction of regular pay, about
400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> the distinction between the ratings ceased to have an
importance for military affairs.</p>

<h4>IV. <i>The Question as to the Connection of the Supernumeraries
and the Seniors with the Military Centuries</i></h4>

<p>A number of supernumeraries termed accensi velati accompanied
the army. The epithet accensi proves them to have
been outside the five ratings, while velati describes them as
wearing civilian dress. We are informed by the sources that
they carried water and weapons to the fighting men, stepped
into the places of the dead and wounded, and acted as servants
to the lower officers.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> These men could not have been organized
in centuries,<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> for they were drawn up in the rear behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
the light troops; they extended along the entire breadth of the
army,<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> and must have greatly exceeded one hundred or even
two hundred. The musicians,<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> too, who accompanied the army
were not grouped in two centuries, for they were distributed
throughout the army.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> There is no reason for assuming exactly
two hundred musicians<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> or exactly two hundred workmen,<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> or
for supposing that any of the men of this description were organized
in centuries in the army. Reasoning in a similar way in
regard to the seniors, we conclude that their organization in
centuries could not have belonged to the original Servian system.
A military century, as the name indicates, must have
contained a hundred men.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> But in any static population there
are three times as many men between seventeen and forty-six
as between forty-six and sixty<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>—in Rome there were three
times as many juniors as seniors; and as the number of junior
and senior centuries was equal, the latter could have contained
only about thirty-three each, on the supposition that the whole
male population between seventeen and forty-six years was
organized in centuries.</p>

<p>The mere fact that the senior century contained so few men
suggests that it was not a military institution. This impression
is confirmed by the information that the seniors were reserved
for the defence of the city, while the juniors took the field in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
active service.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> When we reflect that even in the early republic
the seniors could not often have been called on for defence, as
the juniors were ordinarily sufficient for the purpose,<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> that the
manning of the walls did not necessarily require a division into
companies or an equipment like that for field service, and that
when it was thought expedient for the seniors to serve in centuries
or cohorts, their enrolment in these companies is especially
mentioned, our conviction that the senior centuries did
not belong to the original Servian organization grows into a
certainty.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<h4>V. <i>Conclusions as to the Servian and Early Republican Organizations;
Transition to the Manipular Legion</i></h4>

<p>In our search for the Servian and post-Servian schemes of military
organization we found it necessary to eliminate from the
discriptio centuriarum all the centuries of pedites with the exception
of the juniors. But even a military century of juniors
could not have remained identical with a voting century; for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
former comprised a fixed number and the same for all ratings,
whereas in the comitia of historical time the centuries varied
greatly in size, many of them containing far more than a hundred
men each. In the four lower classes each century contained
as many men as the entire first class;<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> and individuals
constantly shifted from one class to another as their several
properties increased or diminished.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> It is a mistake, therefore,
to think of the army as identical with even the junior centuries
of the comitia.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Doubtless when the Servian army was first
introduced, its organization was made to fit actual conditions, so
that all who were liable to service found their place in it; but as
the political assembly of centuries was instituted many years
afterward, the army with its various enlargements could have
kept meanwhile no more than approximate pace with the
changing population, and at no time could it include the physically
disqualified, who nevertheless had a right to vote in the
junior centuries of the political assembly. On the other hand
there were soldiers in the army too young to be in the comitia
centuriata.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p>The conclusion as to the strength of the army in the first
years of the republic, before the latter had acquired any considerable
accession of territory, corresponds closely with a moderate
estimate of the population under the conditions then
existing. The area of the state was about 983 square kilometers
(equivalent to 379.5 sq. mi. or 242,899 acres).<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> Estimating
the population of this agricultural community at its maximum
of sixty to the square kilometer, we should have less than
60,000 for the entire area.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> The number of men from seventeen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
to sixty, the Roman military age, should be about thirty per
cent of the population<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>—less therefore than 18,000. If the
ratio of juniors to seniors was about three to one,<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> we should
have about 13,000 juniors to 5000 seniors. But a deduction
must be made for slaves and for the physically incapacitated,
leaving perhaps 9000 or 10,000 juniors and 3000 or 4000
seniors. These results are not unreasonable. Making allowance
for several hundred supernumeraries,<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> we should then
have no more than enough juniors to fill the eighty-four centuries
of foot and the six troops of horse. It is clear, therefore,
that all available forces were included in the army and that the
junior centuries could not have contained more than a hundred
men each.</p>

<p>Even before the phalanx had thus been brought to perfection,
modifications were being made in the equipment under the influence
of the Gallic invasion.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> The introduction of pay, about
400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, as has been said,<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> broke down the distinction of equipment
based on degree of wealth, and not long afterward, probably
in the time of the Samnite wars, the phalanx gave way
to the manipular legion, which reached its full development in
the Punic wars.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<h4>VI. <i>The Five Classes and their Ratings</i></h4>

<p>Though originally denoting the men of the first rating, who
possessed the fullest equipment,<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> the term classis with an explanatory
adjective came to apply to the entire army<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> or to its
component parts.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> The plural “classes” came finally to mean
the five census groups, represented by the five timocratic gradations
of the comitia centuriata. What had formerly been the
classis then came to be known as classis prima, and the “infra
classem” ratings were numbered downward second, third,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
fourth, and fifth. Probably this extension in the use of the
word was not made till after the disappearance of the ratings
from the army—how much later we do not know. In a speech
delivered in 169 in favor of the lex Voconia the elder Cato
more than once examined into the meaning of classicus and
infra classem.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> A hasty inference would be that at this late
date classis was still strictly limited to the first rating. It is to be
noted, however, that the early meaning might be retained in a
legal formula long after it had disappeared from general use,
that classicus certainly preserved its original meaning notwithstanding
the new development of the noun from which it is
derived, and especially that the early sense of the terms classicus
and infra classem was not generally known in 169, else Cato
would not have taken such pains to define them. We know
that the ratings were termed classes in 111,<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> and from what has
just been said on the Voconian law it seems probable that the
development took place long before 169. The circumstance
that in their “discriptio centuriarum” Livy and Dionysius make
no reference to the distinction between classis and infra classem
would favor the supposition that they found no such distinction
in their common source—ultimately Fabius Pictor. Hence it
is not unlikely that classis was used in its historical meaning of
property class in the censorial document from which Fabius
derived his knowledge of the fully developed comitia centuriata,
and which belonged to the period immediately following 269.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>Before the censorship of Appius Claudius Caecus, 312, military
service within the census ratings was based on the possession
of land, and the gradations of equipment, while they lasted,
must therefore have been determined by the size of the estate
reckoned in iugera.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> Huschke<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> rightly inferred that the number
of iugera marking the lower limit of each division must
have been proportioned to the later money ratings, and assumed
accordingly 20, 15, 10, 5, 2½ or 2 iugera as the respective minimal
holdings of the five divisions. Although absolute certainty
is unattainable, most scholars accept his conclusions as probable.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
Before the change was made in the appraisements from
amount of land to money, the census gradations ceased to serve
a military purpose. In the further discussion of these groups
reference is therefore solely to their political character,
especially as expressed in the organization of the comitia centuriata.
Till the time of Marius, however, the soldiers were
ordinarily recruited from the classes—that is, from the citizens
who possessed at least the qualification of the lowest group.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>The money ratings of 312 are not recorded; we know those
only of the time following 269. The ratings of the earlier date
must have been in the nominally libral asses then current. For
a long time, probably down to 312, the <i>as</i> remained at eleven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
to nine ounces in weight, then sank rapidly to four, three, and
two ounces, reaching the last-mentioned weight in or shortly
before 269. In this year or the following was legally adopted
the lighter <i>as</i>, weighing two ounces, or a sixth of a pound, and
hence termed sextantarian, and the heavier asses still in circulation
were henceforth reckoned as sesterces, which now became
the unit of value.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Two and a half sextantarian asses made a
sesterce, and four sesterces made a denarius.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> The <i>as</i> continued
to be copper, whereas the sesterce and the denarius were
silver. In consequence of the use of the sextantarian <i>as</i> the
ratings must have been elevated to correspond with the decline
of the standard; and the result of this change is the well-known
series, 100,000, 75,000, 50,000, 25,000, 11,000.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> There can be
no doubt that under the standard used in 312 the ratings were
lower than those given. It is incredible that the classis should
ever have been appraised so high as 100,000 asses of ten-ounce
weight or even of the value of sesterces (5 oz.).<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> But the ratings
of 312 have not been definitely ascertained. Assuming
but one elevation between the two dates and in the proportion
of 4:10:: sextantarian <i>as</i>: heavy <i>as</i> or sesterce, Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
concludes that the appraisements of 312 were 40,000, 30,000,
20,000, 10,000, and 4400 asses respectively for the five classes.
The adjustment however may have been gradual, as was the
decline of the standard, and the former need not have corresponded
exactly with the latter. But in so far as the Romans
failed to bring about this adjustment, the censors must have
found it necessary continually to advance the citizens from the
lower to the higher divisions.</p>

<p>The ratings mentioned above as established on the basis
of the sextantarian standard, namely 100,000, 75,000, 50,000,
25,000, and 11,000 asses for the five classes respectively, are
those given by Livy.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> Several variations affecting the highest
and lowest classes are offered by other writers. Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
states the appraisement of the fifth class at 12½ minae, which
would be 12,500 asses. The usual explanation is that he is dealing
in round numbers without especial regard to accuracy, for
which reason Livy should be given the preference. It is doubtful
however whether Dionysius was so inexact. More probably
his estimate depended ultimately on the idea that the minimal
number of iugera of the highest class was twenty-five,<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> taken in
connection with the decimal ratio between the extreme classes—an
interpretation which would help explain variations in the
rating of the highest class to be mentioned hereafter; or with
less reason we might assume that the statements of Dionysius
and Livy represent earlier and later conditions.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> The limit of
400 drachmas given by Polybius<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> proves a lowering of the minimal
rating between 269 and the publication of his history.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> It
may have been made in 217, when the money system was again
changed. As Polybius probably considered the drachma, or
denarius, to be worth ten asses,<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> the limit which he mentions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
would be 4000 asses. Cicero states the minimal limit at 1500
asses,<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> and a still lower sum of 375, mentioned by Gellius,<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>
marked the line of division between the taxable proletarians
and the capite censi, who were exempt from taxation. As the
differentiation between the two groups last named must have
been effected before 167, when the Romans were relieved of
the tributum,<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> the rating given by Cicero could not have been
later than that vouched for by Polybius. The limit of 4000
asses, accordingly, had reference merely to military service,
whereas 1500 marked at once the political and tributary line
of separation between the fifth class and the taxable proletarians.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>
The limit of 375 asses, on the other hand, was far
below the fifth class, and had nothing to do with it.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> The relation
of these numbers to one another may be summarized as follows:
Those assessed at 4000 or more asses belonged to the
fifth class, enjoyed the political rights of that class, and were
subject to military service as well as to taxation (tributum);
those rated at 1500-4000 asses also belonged to the fifth class,
enjoyed the political rights of that class, and were subject to
taxation but exempt from military service; those rated at 375-1500
asses were proletarians, below the fifth class but subject
to taxation; those rated below 375 asses, the capite censi, were
exempt from taxation.</p>

<p>As regards the rating of the highest class, the elder Pliny<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>
states it at 110,000 asses, which may be a copyist’s error for
100,000 or for 120,000; the estimate of Paulus Diaconus<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> is
120,000 and of Gellius<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> 125,000. If the manuscripts have
correctly preserved these numbers, they may represent computations
based on a varying number of iugera, from twenty-two
to twenty-five<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> at the rate of 5000 asses a iugerum—a valuation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
which may have been given in the original annalistic source
(Fabius Pictor). From the fact that Pliny assigns this rating
to Servius as author, and that Gellius speaks of it in the past,
we must infer that it was not due to a relatively late change.
Indeed the rating must have remained unaltered to the time of
Polybius,<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> who states that those appraised at 10,000 drachmas
wore the cuirass—according to Livy<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> and Dionysius,<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> the distinctive
equipment of the first class.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> In the same age the Voconian
law, 169, provided that a man registered by the censors
as worth 100,000 asses or more should not bequeath his property
to a woman.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> While speaking in favor of the measure
the elder Cato expounded the distinction between the classici
and those who were “infra classem.”<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> Strictly following Cato’s
definition, Gellius<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> explains the classici as those of the first class
in contrast with the members of the lower classes, who are infra
classem. Evidently the classici are to be identified with those
rated at 100,000 asses, as given by Gaius.<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> The sum of 100,000
sesterces, in place of asses, represented by later writers<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> as the
one fixed by this law, is due either to a late interpretation or to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
an amendment.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> The minimal qualification of the first class
must therefore have continued unchanged from 269 to the passing
of the Voconian law, 169, and the composition of the <i>History</i>
of Polybius.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> From the latter event to the tribuneship of
Tiberius Gracchus little time was left for an increase, which
certainly the Gracchi and their successors would take no interest
in bringing about. Further depreciation in the weight of
the <i>as</i>, by the reduction to a half ounce through the Papirian
law of 89,<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> had no effect on the valuation, as the standard was
the silver sesterce, the <i>as</i> having merely the fiduciary value of a
quarter sesterce. Apart from the accounts of Livy and Dionysius
already considered, no reference is made to the valuation
of the intermediate classes, unless it be a passage in Livy<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> to
the effect that freedmen possessing country estates worth at
least 30,000 sesterces were enrolled in the rural tribes by the
censors of 169, which is interpreted by Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> to refer to
the qualification of the second class. This is true if, as has
been assumed above, the censors still reckoned two and a half
asses to the sesterce.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<h4>VII. <i>Belot’s Theory as to the Ratings</i></h4>

<p>Notice must be taken of a theory proposed by Belot,<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> that at
the time of the First Punic War, owing to an economic revolution
which enhanced prices, and to the decrease in the weight of
the <i>as</i>, the five ratings as stated by Dionysius for the earlier
period were multiplied by ten, giving for the future 1,000,000,
750,000, 500,000, 250,000, 125,000 asses for the five classes respectively.<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
The theory is supported with remarkable learning
and skill. There can be no doubt as to the lowering of the
weight of the <i>as</i> or of the economic revolution which increased
prices. Large valuations of estates such as he mentions are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
found in the sources. For example in 214 the government
ordered<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> that—</p>

<table>

  </tr>

    <td></td>
    <td colspan="3">Senators</td>
    <td>should furnish eight sailors.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Belot’s attempt to identify the highest of these appraisements
with the rating of the first class is unsuccessful, as will immediately
appear. The object of the order issued by the government
in 214 was to provide crews for the fleet of that year.
Although the hundred and fifty ships to be manned<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> seem
to have been triremes, we may consider them quinqueremes
so as not to underestimate the number of men necessary.
Reckoning 375 men to the ship,<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> we should have 56,250 men
for the entire fleet. But according to Belot<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> there were 22,000
knights at this time, whose census rating was 1,000,000 asses,
and who accordingly would have to furnish seven men each
for the navy, which would amount to 154,000, or more than
enough to man three such fleets as that of the year under
consideration. But as the knights constituted only a twelfth
of the total number of registered citizens of that period,<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> most
if not all of whom must according to Belot have been assessed
at 50,000 or above, we shall be obliged at least to double the
154,000 sailors furnished by the knights to obtain the whole number
demanded by the government. The absurdity of the result
condemns the premises. The minimal census of the knight could
not have been materially if at all above 100,000 asses,<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> and the
great mass of citizens must have been rated below that sum.
Other features of his theory need not be considered here. The
truth is that the great accumulation of wealth benefited but few;
and notwithstanding the advance in the money value of property,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
the mass of people remained so poor that the state could
not disturb the census ratings, however out of harmony with the
new conditions they seem to have become. No suspicion should
be thrown on the continuance of these small valuations by the
circumstance that occasionally the state compelled the wealthy
to contribute to the burden of war according to their ability, as
in 214, and increased the penalties for the crimes and misdemeanors
which the rich and powerful were wont to commit.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<h4>VIII. <i>The Post-Servian Equites</i></h4>

<p>The classes, as developed after Servius, have now been considered
sufficiently for an appreciation of their relation to the
comitia centuriata. It remains to discuss from the same point of
view the post-Servian alterations in the equestrian organization.</p>

<p>In the earliest period when the warriors in general equipped
themselves at their own expense,<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> the equites provided their own
horses. But in time as the patricians ceased to be the only
wealthy class in the community, and as they began to lose their
political advantages, their duty of keeping one or two horses
came to be felt as onerous, and some means of lightening it was
sought for. The only private property which was free from the
burden of supporting military service was that of widows and
orphans. The government determined accordingly to levy a
regular contribution on this class of estates in the interest of the
equites. The eques was allowed ten thousand asses, or one
thousand denarii (aes equestre), with which to purchase his horse
or horses for the ten years of service and two thousand asses
(aes hordearium) annually for maintenance.<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> He was not paid
the money in advance, but was given security for the required
sums,<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> which were gradually to be made good from the special
kind of tax here described. When these equestrian funds were
first granted cannot be absolutely determined. Cicero<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> assigns
their institution to Tarquinius Priscus, Livy<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> to Servius,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> to Camillus in the year of his censorship, 377. For
obvious reasons the earlier dates are suspicious, whereas the last
has the advantage of connecting the institution of these funds
with the general movement for the public support of military
service. When in the war with Veii regular military pay was
introduced, the eques on account of his more burdensome duty,
perhaps too because of his higher rank, was allowed three times
the pay of the legionary.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> It was afterward decided to deduct
the aes hordearium, probably also the aes equestre, from his
pay.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> Meanwhile as wars were waged on an ever increasing
scale, the patricians, who were dwindling in number, could not
furnish all the cavalry needed. This want was especially felt
in the struggle with Veii, whereupon wealthy plebeian youths<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
came forward and offered to serve with their own horses.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> This
is the first known instance of voluntary equestrian duty, doubtless
often repeated at crises during the remainder of the republican
period. In the first case at least the state provided for
the keep of the horses. The volunteers were of the same grade
of wealth as the conscripts; they were held in equal honor,<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> and
most probably their years of voluntary service were counted in
with their regular duty in making up the required number.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>
Service equo privato could also be imposed as a punishment.
The only known instance, however, was that required by the
censors of 209 of the equites who had disgraced themselves at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
Cannae. Their horses were taken from them, their campaigns
equo publico were not counted to their credit, but they were required
to serve ten years equis privatis.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> These are the only
instances of service with private horses mentioned in history.
In all ancient literature is no suggestion that the equites equo
privato formed a rank by themselves or were an institution.<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> It
should also be said that the injustice of furnishing some with
horses and of compelling others to go to war at their own expense,
unless by way of punishment, was contrary to the spirit
of the constitution. This conclusion is supported by the elder
Pliny’s<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> definition of the military equites, which makes the
public horse an essential. From the time therefore when the
state began to support the mounted service in the way described
above, the equites equis publicis continued to be the only regular
citizen horsemen.</p>

<p>The number of equites with public horses is approximately
determined for any time by the number of legions then enrolled.
The Servian phalanx, as has been noted,<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> consisted of two
legions, which remained the normal number through the fifth
century. But in the wars with Samnium and Pyrrhus Rome
was able regularly to support four legions.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> The military force
could not have been doubled before the incorporation of the
Veientan territory early in the fourth century;<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> most probably
the enlargement belongs to still later time. The increase in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
infantry required a corresponding enlargement of the mounted
service. At least twelve hundred equites were henceforth required
for active duty. Making allowance for reserves and ineffectives,
the government raised the number of equites equo
publico to eighteen hundred. The twelve new centuries were
open alike to patricians and plebeians, whereas the old six remained
for a time exclusively patrician. This seems to have
been the condition at the opening of the first war with Carthage.
During the Punic wars the number varied greatly, sometimes
reaching a total of more than five thousand in the field, not
counting reserves.<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> After the war with Hannibal the state,
drained of men and money, allowed the cavalry to dwindle.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>
Viewing this condition with alarm, the elder Cato<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> urged that
the number should be increased, and that a minimal limit be
fixed at 2200. Probably at the same time he proposed that the
legion should be strengthened. His measure must have been
adopted, for after his censorship we find the legion regularly consisting
of 5200 foot and 300 horse.<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> Under Augustus there were
times when 5000 equites<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> equo publico took part in the parade
which he revived.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> As no reason can be found why Augustus
should suddenly increase this class, we must conclude that there
were probably about 5000 equites equo publico in the late
republic.</p>

<p>As long as the cavalry remained exclusively patrician, a
census qualification was precluded. Though Cicero and Livy
refer the equestrian census to Servius Tullius, their vagueness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
on this point shows that they lacked definite information.<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> It
must have been introduced at the time when the patriciate
ceased to be an essential qualification, when the levy came to be
made on the basis of wealth rather than of blood. This change
should be assigned to the early part of the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>
For a time the census was that of the first class.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> In 214 it was
still 100,000 asses, or not much above, as has already been
proved.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> In the late republic and under the emperors the
minimal rating was 400,000 sesterces.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> When it was raised to
this amount is unknown.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE AUSPICES</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I. <i>Auspicia Privata</i></h4>

<p>Auspices (auspicia) were signs sent by the gods through
which they declared their will to men. Those given in answer
to prayer were impetrativa (or impetrita), those sent unasked
oblativa. The first were necessarily favorable; the second
might be either favorable or the contrary.<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> To take or to hold
auspices was to seek such signs in due form. Auspicia, or the
singular auspicium, also designated the right or the power to
perform the function. They were not a means of prophecy of
future events but of ascertaining whether the deity approved a
proposed action.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> With reference to their object and to the
persons qualified to take them, they were of two kinds, private
and public. Whereas the public auspices, taken in behalf of the
state, belonged exclusively to magistrates, the private were open
to all;<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> and in early times a Roman always resorted to them
before beginning any important business.<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> Though it was permissible
to consult any deity,<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> the greatest weight attached to
the approval of the supreme god Jupiter.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>The plebeians, who as long as they were excluded from the
magistracies were necessarily debarred from the auspicia publica,
enjoyed equally with the patricians all private rights of
religion; in fact if the nobles had wished, they possessed no
legal means of preventing the holding of auspices or the performance
of any other sacred rite in private plebeian houses.
Not only is it stated that all had a right to auspicate,<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> but the
formula for summoning troops given by Cincius<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> implies that
the soldiers, who were mainly plebeian, were accustomed to
perform the rite. We find accordingly the elder Cato, a plebeian,
attending to the ceremony in his own home.<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> The patricians,
however, who believed themselves to be nearer and
dearer to the gods than were the plebeians, and who in their
struggle to keep themselves a closed caste and the offices
barred against the lower social class, declared that conubium if
granted would disturb the private as well as public auspices.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>
But this assertion need not signify that the plebeians had no
private auspices, it might indicate merely a difference between
the plebeian and patrician ceremonies, naturally implying the
superiority of the latter. Again when on a certain occasion
according to Livy a tribune of the plebs inquired of a patrician
why a plebeian could not be made consul, the reply was
that no plebeian had the auspices, reiterating that the decemvirs
had forbidden conubium to prevent the disturbance of the
ceremony by uncertainty of birth.<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> Reference might here be
simply to the auspicia publica, with which alone the consul was
concerned. However this may be, the patrician claim was indignantly
repudiated by the plebeians, and the historian can
say no more than that it was “perhaps true.” Another passage
from Livy usually interpreted in support of the theory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
that the patricians alone had private auspices represents them,
before the opening of the offices to the commons, as saying,
“So peculiar to us are the auspices that not only the patrician
magistrates whom the people choose are elected under the auspices,
but we ourselves under the sanction of the same rite
without a vote of the people appoint the interrex, and we as
private persons hold auspices, which they do not hold even as
magistrates.”<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> This passage is perfectly intelligible to one who
bears in mind that in the late republic private auspices had
disappeared,<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> and that therefore when the word auspicia is used
without qualification by a late republican or imperial writer, it
always has reference to the public ceremonies.<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> In the quotation
just given, accordingly, nothing more is meant than that
the patricians, who have the exclusive right to the offices, are
alone competent to perform the public religious ceremonies
which belong to the magistrates. Reference in the quotation
to the auspices of private persons signifies that when there was
no magistrate competent to hold the election of consuls, the
public auspices returned to the senate, the patrician members
of which proceeded under auspication to appoint an interrex for
holding the elections. In this case the senatorial patricians, it
was asserted, attended to the ceremony not as magistrates but
as private persons, though the rites were themselves public.
As distinguished from magistrates, the senators were privati.
It was not, then, as mere citizens but as patrician members of
the senate that they performed the rite. Further light is
thrown on this subject by the fact that in the agitation for the
opening of the augural and pontifical colleges to the plebeians
in 300, the patricians repeated the assertion that with them
alone were auspices, they alone had family (gens), they alone
possessed true imperium and auspicium in peace and war.<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>
This claim they had the effrontery to make despite the fact that
plebeian consuls had been taking public auspices for more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
sixty years. In the pride of their blood they claimed that theirs
alone were strictly legal (iustum). Notwithstanding such partisan
assertions the facts thus far adduced lead unmistakably
to the conclusion that the plebeians equally with the patricians
enjoyed the right to private auspices.<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

<h4>II. <i>Auspicia Publica Impetrativa</i></h4>

<p>The right to public auspices belonged primarily to patrician
magistracies<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>—those which in the early republic were filled
only by patricians, but which continued to be called patrician
after they were open to plebeians. All elections and appointments
to such offices were auspicated;<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> and their incumbents
were expected to seek the previous approval of Jupiter for every
important act of their administration.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> The king, interrex, dictator,
consuls, praetors, and censors had the auspicia maxima; the
others the minora.<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> The praetor, as colleague of the consuls,
was elected under the same auspices with them, that is, in the
same meeting of the assembly, whereas the censors, not being
colleagues of the consuls, were elected under different auspices.
Between magistrates who were not colleagues there could be no
collision in the auspicia impetrativa; those of the censors neither
strengthened nor vitiated those of the consuls or praetors, nor
were strengthened or vitiated by them. In case of a conflict
between colleagues, the greater auspices annulled the lesser, and
equal auspices annulled each other.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> For the exercise of a
function properly belonging to a magistracy, the incumbent performed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
the ceremony at his own will and pleasure, unless expressly
forbidden by a superior;<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> but one who undertook a
deputed duty had to ask the auspicium of a magistrate who was
competent to perform the duty in his own right. Thus the
quaestor, who was not qualified by right of his office to call the
comitia centuriata, found it necessary to do so in his capital
prosecutions. In such a case he asked of the praetor or consul the
right to hold auspices for summoning this assembly.<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> Whether
the pontifex maximus held auspices in his own name, or was
obliged, like the quaestor, to apply for them to a higher secular
official, is unknown; at all events it was necessary for him to
auspicate the comitia calata, over which he presided.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> It seems
probable that the tribunes originally did not have the right as
they were not magistrates; but when they came to be so considered,
they acquired the auspicium. All magistrates—necessarily
including the tribunes—who convoked the senate had
previously to perform the ceremony;<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> Cicero<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> seems to include
the tribunes among the magistrates who had the auspicium;
and as further proof the very expression “patriciorum (magistratuum)
auspicia”<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> used by Messala implies the existence of
“plebeiorum magistratuum auspicia.” It was not the custom
of the tribunes, however, to auspicate their assemblies of the
plebs.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>For assistance in auspication the magistrate summoned any
person he pleased, who was rarely if ever a public augur.<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> An
augur,<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> whether private or official, was a person who knew
how to hold and to interpret auspices.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> A college of public
augurs<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> for the service of the state was established in the
most primitive times. Probably comprising three members,
one from each tribe, it was gradually increased till under Sulla
it reached fifteen.<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> The members of the college were neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
magistrates<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> nor prophets. They were rather the wise,<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> experienced<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
keepers and expounders of a sacred science and art<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>—the
“interpreters of Jupiter All-Great and Good.”<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> Having
to do with religion, they were sacerdotes, like the pontiffs,
though not offerers of sacrifice (flamines).<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> The functions which
they exercised independently of the magistrates included the
inauguration of religious officials (inaugurare sacerdotes), the
blessing of fields twice a year, and of the people after the
close of a war.<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> In attending to such duties (auguria) only
did they exercise their right to the auspices.<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> In a dependent
though far more influential position they acted as the professionally
skilled advisers and assistants of the magistrates in
all matters of peace and war.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> If a magistrate was not himself
an augur,<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> it was of the utmost importance to have their service;
for the science of discovering and interpreting the divine
omens was intricate, mistakes were easy, and the slightest
oversight might vitiate the whole business in hand. When
in doubt as to the validity of the ceremony, either the magistrate
to whom it belonged or the senate could refer the case
to the college of augurs, which thereupon gave an opinion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
in the form of a decree. The senate then acted on the
matter according to its judgment.<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> In case a law had been
passed, a magistrate elected, or any public act performed
against its wishes, it could inquire of the college of augurs
whether the election or other act had been duly auspicated;
and should a defect be alleged, the senate could annul the
act or request the magistrate to resign. It required unusual
courage in a man to keep himself in office in defiance of the
authority of the senate and of the religious feeling of the
whole people.<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> These considerations account for the great
importance attaching to the presence of augurs in the comitia—a
subject to be treated in another connection.<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

<p>The service of augurs was most needed in establishing the
terrestrial templum<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>—a carefully marked out, oriented spot
which the magistrate occupied while performing the rite.<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>
Whereas the commander of an army generally made use of
chicken auspices (signa ex tripudiis), which did not require
their assistance,<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> they were doubtless always called upon to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
institute templa in or near the city.<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> For the exercise of
their art they divided the world, so far as known to them, into
augural districts. The central district was the city, limited by
the pomerium,<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> beyond which, probably extending to the first
milestone,<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> lay a zone termed ager effatus,<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> whose boundaries
were marked by cippi.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> The rest of the world within their
sphere of knowledge they divided into ager Romanus, which in its
larger sense included the two districts above mentioned, Gabinus,
peregrinus, hosticus, and incertus.<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> For the comitia the
two inner regions were alone important: (1) the auspication of
assemblies held in the city had to be performed within the
pomerium; (2) as often as the magistrate in passing from the
city to the Campus Martius to hold the comitia centuriata
crossed the pomerium,<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> or more strictly the brook Petronia,<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> he
was obliged to take the special auspices of crossing. Beyond
the ager effatus assemblies were not ordinarily held.</p>

<p>Originally the most common form of divination must have
been the watching of the flight of birds, for it is from this ceremony
that the word auspicium is derived.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> Legend accordingly
asserts that Romulus founded the city on the Palatine under the
auspices of twelve vultures.<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> Before the end of the republic,
however, all other forms of public auspicia impetrativa in the
city had given way to the caelestia, especially the lightning and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
thunder.<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> The reason is that the heavenly signs could be most
easily understood and carried greatest weight; whereas other
auspices had to be held for each individual act, the celestial
omens of the morning served the magistrate for all his undertakings
during the entire day.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> The effect of heavenly signs
on assemblies of the people, however, was peculiar. Not only
were comitia and contiones interrupted by storms;<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> not only was
it impious to hold an assembly while it was lightning or thundering,<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>
but even while the magistrate was auspicating at daybreak,
if a flash of lightning appeared on the left—a sign
favorable for every other undertaking—he dared not hold the
assembly on that day.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> Some favorable comitial sign the magistrate
was supposed to perceive,<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> but what it was we do not
know.</p>

<p>The general rule that the auspices should be taken for an act
on the very spot on which the magistrate intended to perform
the act applied to the comitial auspices. For meetings on the
Capitoline Hill they probably used the temple of Jupiter, dedicated
for all time;<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> for assemblies in the comitium the rostra,
also a templum;<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> and for the comitia centuriata the president’s
platform in the Campus Martius.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> Not only patrician magistrates
but also tribunes of the plebs occupied templa in transacting
business with the people.<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>Between midnight and morning<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> on the day of assembly the
magistrate repaired to the templum.<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> There, placing himself on
a solid<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> seat at the door, usually facing eastward, he watched
the heavens (spectio). Meanwhile he first asked the attendant,
who always sat near,<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> whether there was silence.<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> If the
answer was affirmative, he prayed Jupiter for a sign, which he
described in a formula termed legum dictio,<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> whereupon the
attendant declared he saw it.<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> In case of non-appearance of the
sign or of a disturbance of the observation, the auspication was
deferred to another morning.<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> Before the time of Cicero, however,
the ceremony had been so reduced to a pretence as practically
to eliminate the possibility of failure.<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>Both curiate<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> and centuriate<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> assemblies were auspicated.
Although for the tribal assemblies the question is more difficult,
it seems reasonably certain that whereas a patrician magistrate
took the auspices for the comitia tributa,<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> plebeian magistrates
(tribunes and aediles of the plebs) did not.<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a></p>

<p>As to whether contiones were auspicated we are not clearly
informed. The question concerns those only which were held
by patrician magistrates. The auspication of comitia necessarily
extended to the contio immediately preceding.<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
known, too, that the censors auspicated the lustral gathering of
the centuries,<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> hence we may infer that magistrates and sacerdotes
were accustomed to take auspices for formal religious
assemblies.<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> With these exceptions contiones were doubtless
held without auspices by patrician as well as by plebeian magistrates.</p>

<h4>III. <i>Auspicia Publica Oblativa</i></h4>

<p>If Jupiter had approved the holding of an assembly, the magistrate
was not for that reason necessarily done with auspices.
Though the impetrativa may have favored, prohibitive oblativa
were still possible, for circumstances might cause the god to
change his mind so as to forbid what he had previously sanctioned;
and the warning omen might come at any time before
the act was completed. Sometimes the magistrate himself discovered,
or for the accomplishment of his purpose pretended to
discover, the evil omen. When for instance Pompey was holding
an assembly for the election of praetors, and Cato, a political
opponent, offered himself as a candidate, Pompey, seeing the
assembly unanimous for this man, declared that he heard a clap
of thunder, and thus by an adjournment succeeded in preventing
the election.<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> Sometimes the magistrate was informed of the
omen by (1) a private person, (2) an augur, or (3) another
magistrate. In the first two cases the report was termed nuntiatio,
in the third obnuntiatio.<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> Information received from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
private citizen the president could credit or not as he saw fit, or
he could declare it irrelevant;<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> but the law compelled him to
accept the nuntiatio of an augur or the obnuntiatio of another
magistrate.</p>

<p>Prohibitive auspicia oblativa included evil omens of all kinds.
When in 310 the dictator called the curiae for passing the lex
de imperio, it chanced that the Curia Faucia was the first to
vote (principium). Now this curia was ill omened because on
two earlier occasions it had happened to be principium at a time
of great national disaster. The dictator accordingly adjourned
the meeting till the following day, when he again summoned
it after renewing the auspicia impetrativa.<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> A case of epilepsy,
by vitiating the business of the assembly, required an adjournment;
and for that reason the malady was called the comitial
sickness.<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> In the later republic the chief oblativa had come to
be caelestia; and it could happen that the auspicia impetrativa
of any magistrate might as oblativa vitiate the comitia of another.
For this reason when a higher magistrate was about
to hold an assembly, he forbade the taking of auspices by all
inferior to him, for fear they might annul his proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<p>Although the augurs had neither the auspicia impetrativa nor
the right to watch the sky for unfavorable omens,<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> they were
competent to report (nuntiatio) unexpected oblativa to the magistrates.<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>
Their object in attending the comitia accordingly was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
not only to assist the president with their special knowledge,<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>
but also to witness the religious legality of the proceeding. In
the latter function the augur derived great influence<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> from the
possibility of an investigation into such legality by the augural
college and the senate, which might result in the annulment of
the act.<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> For this reason witnessing augurs were granted the
privilege of adjourning the assembly in case they perceived
unfavorable omens.<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> Cicero<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> describes in detail such an adjournment
of an electoral assembly of centuries: “Behold the
day for the election of Dolabella! The prerogative century is
drawn by lot, he (the augur) remains quiet. The vote is announced,
he is silent. The first class is called and the announcement
made. Then as usual the suffragia (of the equites?) were
summoned; then the second class is called. All this happened
more quickly than I have told it.</p>

<p>“When the business is over, that excellent augur says, ‘We
adjourn to another day.’ O remarkable impudence! What
(omen) had you seen? What had you felt? What had you
heard?” Antony, who was both consul and augur, presiding
over the electoral assembly, allowed the voting to continue till
a majority was nearly reached in favor of Dolabella, when,
making use of the augural formula, he adjourned the meeting.
This procedure was in itself legal; but Antony had from the
beginning of the year boasted of his intention to prevent through
augury this man’s election. As only magistrates, through their
right to the spectio, to be explained hereafter, could with certainty
predict an evil omen,<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> it was evident that Antony, acting
merely as augur, made a fictitious report.</p>

<p>Augurs were always present at meetings of the curiae,<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
the centuries,<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> and of the tribes under the presidency of a patrician
magistrate.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> That they attended the meetings of the plebs
as well and had the same relation to the plebeian as to the other
assemblies is necessarily implied in Cicero’s<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> question, “What
shows greater religious power than to be able to grant or refuse
to grant the right to transact business with the people or with
the plebs?”</p>

<p>If the person who reported the evil omen was not an augur
but a magistrate, the president was equally bound to heed it and
to dismiss the assembly;<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> and the force of the obnuntiatio was
not in any way affected by the relative official rank of the two
persons concerned. When accordingly a higher magistrate had
set a day for an assembly, he forbade all inferior magistrates not
only to take the auspicia impetrativa,<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> but also to watch the sky—de
caelo servare—for any purpose on that day, for fear that
some omen unfavorable to the comitia might be seen.<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> A
consul for instance could prevent a quaestor from scanning the
heavens on any particular day; and the senate on the rare occasions
when it felt itself sufficiently strong, suspended for a particular
act of the assembly the right of all magistrates to receive
and to announce unfavorable omens.<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> In the absence of senatorial
interference it remained possible for any higher magistrate
to scan the heavens—de caelo servare—on an assembly
day appointed by another, and to vitiate the comitia by reporting
an unfavorable omen. We find accordingly a consul obnuntiating
against a colleague<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> and against the pontifex maximus,<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
a praetor against a tribune of the plebs,<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> and a tribune against
a consul<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> or a censor,<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> as well as against a colleague.<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<p>So certain was it that a magistrate who looked for a bad omen
would see one that the expression “to watch the sky” became
equivalent to discovering an unpropitious sign. The rule was
therefore formulated that “religion forbade the transaction of
any business with the people when it was known that the sky
was watched.”<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> If accordingly a magistrate announced that he
intended to scan the heavens on the day appointed for an assembly,
this declaration was in itself sufficient in the ordinary
course of events to compel a postponement. In the year 57 Milo,
a tribune of the plebs, pushed the custom to extremes by declaring
his intention to observe the sky on all comitial days.<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> Strictly
the observation had to be made and reported before the assembly
met. “Can any one divine beforehand,” Cicero<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> asks, “what
defect there will be in the auspices, except the man who has
already determined to watch the heavens? This in the first place
the law forbids to be done in the time of an assembly; and if
any one has been observing the sky, he is bound to give notice
of it, not after the comitia are assembled, but before they meet.”
In the case belonging to the year 57 referred to above, Milo, the
tribune, came into the Campus Martius before midnight in order
to anticipate the arrival of the consul Metellus, who wished to
hold the elections. The assembly ordinarily met at sunrise, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
could not convene after midday. Milo accordingly remained on
that day till noon, without seeing the consul. Then Metellus
demanded that for the future the obnuntiatio should be served
on him in the Forum; it was unnecessary, he said, to go to the
Campus before daybreak; he promised to be in the comitium
at the first hour of the day. As Milo was coming into the Forum
before sunrise on the next comitial day, he discovered Metellus
stealing hurriedly to the Campus by an unusual route. The
tribune came upon him and served the notice.<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p>The consul’s announcement of intention to watch the sky
might be strengthened by a proclamation declaring certain or
all comitial days for the remainder of the year to be holidays,
on which the people could not legally transact business in
assembly.<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<p>Although the obnuntiatio doubtless originated in the early
republic, it played no considerable part in political strife till
after the Gracchi. A great impetus to the abuse of the power
was given by the Aelian and Fufian laws, which were probably
two plebiscites<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> passed about 150.<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> What features of these
statutes were new has not been precisely determined. It is certain,
however, that they made possible the condition in which
we find the spectio and obnuntiatio before the legislation of
Clodius on the subject in 58. As the tribune did not originally
have the obnuntiatio, we may infer that in all probability these
laws granted him the right to exercise it against patrician magistrates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
in the way described above. Similarly from the fact
that the plebeian tribal assembly was not originally subject to
religious obstruction on the part of the government, it is reasonable
to conclude that the Aelian and Fufian statutes gave the
patrician magistrates the obnuntiatio against that body.<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> It was
equivalent to a power of veto, which the aristocracy could now
exercise upon tribunician legislation, hence Cicero<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> regards the
two statutes as most holy<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> means of “weakening and repressing
the fury of the tribunes,” and as the “surest protection of the
commonwealth.”<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> Notwithstanding the opinion of Lange,<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> that
the obnuntiatio was restricted to legislation, it seems clear from
the words of Cicero,<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> as well as from the lack of reference
in the sources to such a limitation, that it applied equally to
elections. So long, however, as the nobility could depend for
support upon the tribunes, it had little need of such a power.
But in the last years of the republic, after the tribunician veto
had been undermined by Ti. Gracchus and Appuleius Saturninus,
and the tribunes were again acting independently of the
senate as in the early history of their office, optimates and populares,
taking full advantage of the Aelian and Fufian laws,
alike exploited the auspices recklessly for partisan objects.
Their behavior was a sign of both religious and political disintegration.
Vatinius, tribune of the plebs in 59, had the boldness
utterly to disregard these statutes;<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> and in 58 the tribune
Clodius repealed them in so far as they affected legislation,<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>
whereas for elections the obnuntiatio still remained in force.<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>
The misuse of auspices for political purposes dates back,
according to Livy,<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> to the beginning of the Samnite wars.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Although this may be an anticipation of later conditions, there
can be no doubt as to the attitude of statesmen toward the custom
in the closing years of the Punic wars.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> In the time of Clodius
and Cicero, while some maintained a sincere belief in these
ceremonies, doubtless the great majority of public men saw in
their use nothing more than political chicanery calculated, by
deceiving the multitude, to keep the real power in the hands of
a few.<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">COMITIA AND CONCILIUM</span></h3>

</div>

<p>In treating of the distinction between comitia and concilium
scholars have invariably begun with the juristic definition of
Laelius Felix,<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> quoted by Gellius,<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> “He who orders not the
whole people but some part of it to be present (in assembly)
ought to proclaim not comitia but a concilium;” they have
limited themselves to illustrating this definition, and to setting
down as lax or inaccurate the many uses of the two words which
cannot be forced into line with it. The object of this discussion,
on the contrary, is to consider all the occurrences of these
words in the principal extant literature, especially prose, of the
republic and of the Augustan age—a period in which the assemblies
were still in existence—for the purpose of testing the
definition of Laelius, and of establishing new definitions by
induction in case his should prove wrong.</p>

<p>It is convenient to begin with Livy, who though an imperial
writer, and under the stylistic influence of his age, probably adhered
in the main to the technical terminology of the republican
annalists from whom he drew. The first point which will be
established is that in Livy’s usage the difference between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
comitia and concilium is not a difference between the whole
people and a part of the people.<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>The plebeian tribal assembly is termed comitia in Livy ii. 56.
1, 2; ii. 58. 1; ii. 60. 4; iii. 13. 9 (“Verginio comitia habente
conlegae appellati dimisere concilium,” in which comitia and
concilium in one sentence are applied to the same assembly);
iii. 17. 4 (the comitia for passing the Terentilian law, which
from Livy’s point of view was the plebeian assembly);<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> iii. 24.
9; iii. 30. 6; iii. 51. 8 (comitia of plebeian soldiers for electing
military tribunes and tribunes of the plebs); iii. 54. 9, 11: (plebeian
comitia under the pontifex maximus); iv. 44. 1; v. 10.
10; vi. 35. 10 (“Comitia praeter aedilium tribunorumque plebi
nulla sunt habita”); vi. 36. 9 (the comitia for voting on the
Licinian-Sextian laws); vi. 39. 5; xxv. 4. 6; xxxiv. 2. 11; xlv.
35. 7. Other examples of comitia of a part of the people are
Livy ii. 64. 1 (as the plebeians refused to participate in the consular
election, the patricians and clients held the comitia); xxvi.
2. 2 (comitia held by the soldiers, and hence by only a part of
the people, for the election of a propraetor). Still more to the
point are the comitia sacerdotum: for electing a chief pontiff,
Livy xxv. 5. 2; for electing an augur, xxxix. 45. 8; for electing
a chief curio, xxvii. 8. 1. Comitia sacerdotum were composed
of seventeen tribes, and hence of only a part of the people.<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>
Lastly is to be noted the fact that the plebeian assembly met on
a comitialis dies; Livy iii. 11. 3.</p>

<p>It is now sufficiently established that Livy often applies the
term comitia to the assembly of plebs and to other assemblies
which included but a part of the people. It is equally true that
he uses concilium to denote an assembly of the whole people.
The principal instances of Roman assemblies are:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) Livy i. 8. 1: “Vocataque ad concilium multitudine, quae coalescere in
populi unius corpus nulla re praeterquam legibus poterat, iura dedit.”</p>

<p>(2) i. 26. 5: “Concilio populi advocato” (for the trial of Horatius).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>(3) i. 36. 6: “Auguriis certe sacerdotioque augurum tantus honos accessit, ut
nihil belli domique postea nisi auspicato gereretur, concilia populi,
exercitus vocati, summa rerum, ubi aves non admississent, dirimerentur.”</p>

<p>(4) ii. 7. 7: “Vocato ad concilium populo” (representing the consul as calling
the people to an assembly).</p>

<p>(5) iii. 71. 3: “Concilio populi a magistratibus dato” (for settling the dispute
between Ardea and Aricia).</p>

<p>(6) vi. 20. 11: “Concilium populi indictum est” (an assembly of the people
which condemned Marcus Manlius).</p>

</div>

<p>These instances are well known, and have often been discussed.
It is enough for our purpose to note here that they
prove Livy’s willingness to designate assemblies of the whole
Roman people as concilia. But Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> was not satisfied
with regarding all these cases as inaccurate. In spite of
Laelius he believed that concilium could sometimes properly
apply to assemblies of all the people. With reference to the
first example given above he says that where concilium denotes
an assembly of all the people, the contio is meant—in other
words, a concilium of all the people is an assembly which has
not been summoned with a view to voting, and is not organized
in voting divisions. This new definition might explain example
(1), for possibly Livy did not think of the first Roman assembly
as voting on the laws which Romulus gave, or even as organized.
Unfortunately Mommsen tries to support his definition by example
(2), which refers to the assembly for the trial of Horatius.
But in ch. 26. 12 the same assembly, which must have been the
gathering of the curiae, and which Cicero<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> speaks of as comitia,
voted the acquittal of the accused. Hence it could not have
been a mere contio. Another passage cited in support of his
view, Livy ii. 7. 7, example (4), represents the consul as calling
the people to a concilium. First he addressed them (“in contionem
escendit”), and afterward laws were passed on the subject
of which he treated in his speech—evidently by the same
assembly; hence the concilium populi here mentioned was something
more than a contio. Another illustration which Mommsen
offers, but which, having to do with a Roman assembly only
by implication, is not included in the list of examples given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
above, is Livy v. 43. 8: “When he had pushed into the midst
of the contio, though hitherto accustomed to keep away from
such concilia.”<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> The passage refers to a meeting of the Ardeates
for consulting in regard to the sudden approach of the
Gauls. Gatherings of the kind were called concilia, but the word
contio is also introduced into the passage with reference to a
speech made in the assembly. The implication is that such
concilia of all the people for deliberation were held also at
Rome. The circumstances indicate that it met with a view also
to taking action, and that it was therefore not a simple contio.
This passage accordingly offers no support to Mommsen’s view
that when applied to the whole people concilium is merely a
listening, not an acting, assembly.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> Summing up the evidence
for the new definition of concilium, we may say that, were it
true, it might apply to Livy i. 8. 1, though it is unessential to
the explanation either of this passage or of any other. A single
case, too, even if it were clear, is not a sufficient basis for a
generalization; and though we must agree with Mommsen that
the juristic definition does not cover the cases cited above, it is
necessary to reject his amendment as unsatisfactory.<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></p>

<p>In fact Mommsen soon discovers cases which, from his own
admission, neither his definition nor that of Laelius will explain,
for instance, Livy i. 36. 6, example (3). On this citation Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>
remarks that concilia in this connection could not mean
contiones, with which in his opinion the auspices had nothing to
do; it could not refer to the plebeian assemblies, which he also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
assumes to have been free from the auspices.<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> He concludes,
therefore, that it denotes the “patricio-plebeian” tribal assemblies.<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>
But why Livy should here be thinking merely of the
tribal assemblies, especially in connection with a time before
they had come into existence, no one could possibly explain. It
is far more reasonable to assume that he intended to include all
kinds of assemblies, curiate, centuriate, and tribal, which required
the auspices. The next citation which Mommsen finds
difficult is Livy iii. 71. 3, example (5)—an assembly of the tribes
meeting under the consuls to decide the dispute between Ardea
and Aricia over a piece of territory. The assembly voted (ch.
72. 6) that the land in question belonged to the Roman people.
Mommsen’s<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> explanation of concilium in this connection is that
the resolution adopted by this assembly affected foreign states
only, and was not binding on Rome; hence he assumes that
comitia are an assembly whose resolutions are binding on the
Roman state. Here then we have a third definition of concilium
based like the second on a single case. But Mommsen thinks
he finds some evidence for his last definition in the fact that assemblies
of foreign states are usually termed concilia; and he
assumes the reason to be that their resolutions were not binding
on Rome. It would be strange, however, if in calling foreign
institutions by Latin names (rex, senatus, populus, plebs, praetor,
dictator, etc.) Roman writers attempted to show a connection
between these institutions and Rome, seeing that in most cases
no such connection could exist. The proposed explanation of
this use of concilium becomes actually absurd when it is extended
to foreign comitia; Mommsen certainly would not say that the
resolutions of the Syracusan comitia, mentioned by Livy, were
binding on Rome.</p>

<p>His last and most difficult case is Livy vi. 20. 11—the concilium
populi which condemned Marcus Manlius, example (6),
p. 121. Evidently this was the centuriate assembly, which alone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
had the right to try capital cases, and which alone had to meet
outside the pomerium. Various feeble explanations have been
proposed; but Mommsen, with others, prefers to consider the
word wrongly used. It is true that if we accept the juristic
definition, we must conclude that Livy is guilty of error not only
in this case but wherever he applies the term concilium to an
assembly of all the people, Roman or foreign; but as we shall
proceed by induction, we must, at least provisionally, consider
all the cases correct, and frame our definitions accordingly.</p>

<p>We have now reviewed a number of passages in Livy in
which concilium includes all the Romans. There remains a
large group of passages which refer to foreign assemblies. In
considering these cases we are to bear in mind that the Romans
apply to foreign institutions in general the Latin terms with
which they are familiar, and in the same sense in which these
terms are used of Roman institutions; in this way only could
they make themselves understood.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Concilium populi and concilia populorum are frequent (e.g. Livy vii. 25.
5; x. 10. 11; 14. 3; xxi. 14. 1; xxiv. 37. 11), and most of the assemblies
of foreign states designated as concilia are known to have admitted both
nobles and commons.</p>

<p>Instances of concilia in foreign states are: Alba Longa, Livy i. 6. 1; Latins,
Livy i. 50-52; vi. 10. 7; vii. 25. 5; viii. 3. 10; xxvii. 9. 2; Aequians, Livy iii.

27. 11; 48. 1; xxxvi. 31. 9, 10; 32. 9; 34. 1; 35. 7; xxxviii. 31. 1; 32. 3;
34. 5; 35. 1; xxxix. 33, 35, 36, 37, 48, 50; xli. 24; xlii. 12; xliii. 17; Epirus,
Livy xxxii. 10. 2; xlii. 38. 1: Boeotians, Livy xxxiii. 1. 7; 2. 1, 7; xxxvi. 6.

Livy xxxiv. 51. 5; xxxv. 31. 3; xxxvi. 8. 2; xlii. 38; Argos, Livy xlii.
44; Macedonians, Livy xlv. 18.</p>

</div>

<p>Though most of these concilia are known to have been
assemblies of the whole people, nobles and commons, very
rarely, as in Livy x. 16. 3, the word signifies a council of a few
men—in this case, of the leading men of Etruria (cf. xxxvi. 6.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
6); and twice, at Capua, we hear of a plebis concilium; Livy
xxiii. 4. 4; xxvi. 16. 9. From the frequency of the first-mentioned
use we must conclude that Livy does not hesitate to
designate as concilia assemblies of the whole people.</p>

<p>Comitia, on the other hand, more rarely applies to foreign
assemblies. We hear of comitia of the Veientans (Livy v. 1. 1),
of the Syracusans (Livy xxiv. 23. 1; 26. 16; 27. 1), of the
Argives (Livy xxxii. 25. 2), of the Boeotians (Livy xxxiii. 27. 8),
and of the Thessalians (Livy xxxiv. 51. 5).</p>

<p>The conclusions thus far reached are as follows:</p>

<p>I. As to Comitia:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Livy frequently uses comitia to denote the tribal assembly of the plebs.</p>

<p>2. He always uses comitia to denote the assembly for the election of priests,
consisting of but seventeen tribes, and hence of a minority of the
people.</p>

</div>

<p>II. As to Concilium:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. He frequently uses concilia (rarely comitia) to denote foreign assemblies
of all the people.</p>

<p>2. Less frequently he uses concilia to denote Roman assemblies of all the
people.</p>

</div>

<p>Mommsen and others admit, however, that Livy’s usage does
not conform strictly to the definition of Laelius Felix; they
assume accordingly that the exact meaning of comitia was lost
in imperial times, that for the correct usage we should look to
the republican writers.</p>

<p>As Caesar has little occasion for employing the terms in relation
to the Roman assemblies, his usage on purely Roman
grounds cannot be made out. Foreign assemblies—that is, of
Gauls—he generally designates as concilia: <i>B. G.</i> i. 30, 31; iii.
18; v. 2, 6, 24, 56 f.; vi. 3, 20; vii. 63, 89; viii. 20 (Hirtius).
In all these cases the concilium is a tribal or national assembly
including both nobles and commons; more rarely the word
signifies a council of chiefs; <i>B. G.</i> i. 33; vii. 75; and perhaps
vii. 1. Once he applies comitia to Gallic assemblies; <i>B. G.</i> vii.
67. So far, therefore, as his usage can be determined, it does
not differ from Livy’s. From Macrobius, <i>Sat.</i> i. 16. 29 (“Contra
Julius Caesar XVI auspiciorum negat, nundinis contionem
advocari posse: id est cum populo agere: ideoque nundinis
Romanorum haberi comitia non posse”), it appears that in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
Lucius Julius Caesar’s<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> augural language, which must certainly
have been conservative, contio was a general word including
comitia. This passage, with the similar one in Cicero, <i>Att.</i> iv.
3. 4, suggests that the distinctions between contio, comitia, and
concilium, far from breaking down in late republican times,
were only then taking form.</p>

<p>The material furnished by Sallust is more conclusive. In
<i>Hist.</i> ii. 22, concilium Gallorum doubtless signifies a national
assembly; and although generally comitia refers to the centuriate
gathering (<i>Cat.</i> 24, 26; <i>Iug.</i> 36, 44), in <i>Iug.</i> 37 (“P. Lucullus
and L. Annius, tribunes of the plebs, against the efforts of their
colleagues strove to prolong their office, and this dissension put
off the comitia through all the rest of the year”)<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> it clearly
designates the assembly of the plebs. His usage accordingly,
which allows concilium sometimes to apply to an assembly of
the whole people and comitia to an assembly of a part of the
people, does not differ from that of Livy.</p>

<p>Cicero, however, is the author on whom scholars rely in support
of the definition of Laelius. Following Berns,<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> they say
Cicero has violated the rule but once, <i>Att.</i> i. 1. 1, in which occurs
the phrase comitiis tribuniciis. Berns’ examination of Cicero
must have been exceedingly hasty, as he has left a number of
instances unnoticed. The following passage is especially to the
point, <i>Q. Fr.</i> ii. 14 (15 b). 4:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The candidates for the tribuneship have made a mutual compact—having
deposited five hundred sestertia apiece with Cato, they agree to conduct
their canvass according to his direction, with the understanding that any one
offending against it is to be condemned by him. If these comitia, then, turn
out to be pure, Cato will have been of more avail than all laws and jurors put
together.”<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>The tribunician comitia are the only comitia concerned in
Cato’s transaction. Again in <i>Att.</i> ii. 23. 3 (“It is of great interest
to me that you should be present at Rome, if not at the
comitia for his election, at least after he has been declared
elected”)<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> Cicero is thinking of the election of Clodius to the
tribuneship, and hence the comitia he refers to are the assembly
of plebs. In <i>Fam.</i> viii. 4. 3, “aedilium plebis comitiis” must
refer to the plebeian assembly, in which the plebeian aediles
were elected.<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Another important passage is <i>Sest.</i> 51. 109:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I come now to the comitia whether for electing magistrates or for enacting
laws. We often see laws passed in great numbers. I say nothing of
those which are enacted in such a manner that scarcely five of each tribe, and
those not from their own tribe, voted for them. He (Clodius) says that at
the time of that ruin of the republic he carried a law concerning me, whom he
called a tyrant and the destroyer of liberty. Who is there who will confess
that he gave a vote when this law was passed against me? But when in compliance
with the same resolution of the senate, a law was passed about me in
the comitia centuriata, who is there who does not profess that then he was
present, and that he gave a vote in favor of my safety? Which cause, then,
is the one which ought to appear popular? That in which everything that is
honorable in the city, and every age, and every rank of men agree? Or that
to the carrying of which some excited furies fly as if hastening to a banquet
on the funeral of the republic?”<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The law which Cicero dwells on with such bitterness at the beginning
of this passage and recurs to at the end is the tribunician
law which pronounced on him the sentence of exile; in this
connection, therefore, comitia distinctly includes the plebeian
assembly in its legislative capacity.</p>

<p>Even more telling is <i>Leg.</i> iii. 19. 44-45:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They (our ancestors) forbade the enactment of laws regarding particular
persons except by the comitia centuriata. For when the people are organized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
according to wealth, rank, and age, they use more consideration in giving their
votes than when summoned promiscuously by tribes. In our case, therefore,
a man of great ability and of consummate prudence, Lucius Cotta, truly insisted
that no act whatever had been passed regarding us; for in addition to
the fact that those comitia had been held wholly under the fear of armed
slaves, the comitia tributa could not legally pass capital sentences or privilegia.
Consequently there was no need of a law to reinstate us, against whom
exile had not been legally pronounced. But it seemed better both to you
and to other most illustrious men that all Italy should show what it felt concerning
that same person against whom some slaves and robbers declared
they had passed a decree.”<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Cicero is here contrasting the comitia centuriata, which recalled
him, with the tribal assembly of the plebs, which pronounced the
sentence of exile. Now as he was condemned by the plebeian
assembly, it is clear that in this passage Cicero calls the plebeian
assembly comitia. How Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> can make this citation refer
to his “patricio-plebeian” comitia tributa no one can possibly explain.
In <i>Att.</i> iii. 12. 1, comitia expressly includes the tribunician
elections. The same elections are twice called comitia in <i>Att.</i> iii.
14; and in iii. 13. 1, Cicero, again mentioning these comitia, says:
“In tribunis plebis designatis reliqua spes est.” From all these
passages it becomes evident that Cicero regards the plebeian assembly
as comitia. In many passages comitia seems to include all
the elections of the year, of plebeian as well as of patrician magistrates;
for the elections were usually held in the same season,
and could not well be separated in thought.<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> In fact, according
to Cicero’s usage, comitia includes all kinds of national assemblies
which do not come under the term contiones; cf. <i>Sest.</i> 50. 106:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In three places can the judgment and the will of the Roman people be
best discovered, in contio, in comitia, and in the gathering for the festivals
and the gladiatorial shows.”<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> Cf. also 54. 115; 59. 125.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>The very phrase comitia populi (<i>Rep.</i> ii. 32. 56; <i>Div.</i> ii. 18.
42) implies the existence of other comitia, for instance comitia
plebis. It is not strange, therefore, that Cicero should use the following
expression; <i>Rep.</i> i. 33. 50: “The nobles who have arrogated
to themselves this name, not with the consent of the people,
but by their own comitia.”<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> Here he makes it evident that there
may be comitia of the nobles in contrast with the “consent of the
people.” Should the senate usurp the elective function, Cicero
would not hesitate to call that small body comitia, as appears from
his ironical expressions in <i>Phil.</i> xi. 8. 19 (“Quod si comitia placet
in senatu haberi” and “Quae igitur haec comitia”), in which he
anticipates imperial usage; cf. Vell. ii. 124; Tac. <i>Ann.</i> i. 15.</p>

<p>Furthermore he speaks of comitia, consisting of but seventeen
tribes, for the election of sacerdotes; <i>Cael.</i> 8. 19; <i>Leg. Agr.</i> ii.
7. 18; <i>Ad Brut.</i> i. 5. 3 f.; 14. 1; <i>Fam.</i> viii. 12. 4; 14. 1.</p>

<p>From his point of view, a tribal assembly of the whole people
was one which consisted of all thirty-five tribes, irrespective of the
number present in the several tribes, irrespective, too, of the rank
of those who attended. An assembly tributim of a part of the
people, on the other hand, was one in which some of the tribes were
unrepresented. All this is clearly expressed in <i>Leg. Agr.</i> ii. 7. 16 f.:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For it orders the tribune of the plebs who has passed this law to elect ten
decemvirs by the votes of seventeen tribes in such a way that he shall be
decemvir whom nine tribes (a majority of the seventeen) have elected. Here
I ask on what account he (the proposer of the law) has made a beginning
of his measures and statutes in such form as to deprive the Roman people of
their right to vote.... For since it is fitting for every power, command,
and commission to proceed from the entire Roman people, those especially
ought to do so which are established for some use or advantage of the people,
in which case they all together choose also the man who they think will look
out more carefully for the interest of the Roman people, and each one by his
own zeal and his own vote assists to make a road by which he may obtain
some individual benefit for himself. This is the tribune to whom it has
occurred, more than to any one else, to deprive the entire Roman people of
the right to vote, and to summon a few tribes, not by any fixed legal condition,
but by the favor of sortition, to usurp the liberty of all.”<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>Even if the tribes were represented by no more than five men
each, and these men not voting in their own tribes, the assembly
was nevertheless comitia tributa populi.<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> This distinction—recognized
by Cicero and his contemporaries—between an
assembly of the whole people as represented by all the voting
divisions and an assembly of a part of the people as represented
by some of the voting divisions, is incompatible with the distinction
formulated by Laelius. Though an antiquarian might make
much of the presence or absence of a few patricians, a man who
lived in the present, as did Cicero, probably never troubled himself
about such unpractical matters.<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

<p>From the evidence as to Cicero’s usage given above, we must
draw the following conclusions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. He often uses comitia to denote the plebeian tribal assembly, just as
Livy does.</p>

<p>2. He regularly uses comitia to denote the assembly of seventeen tribes
for the election of sacerdotes. In this respect his usage is the same
as Livy’s.</p>

<p>3. He is ready to call the senate comitia, should it usurp the elective function—an
anticipation of imperial usage.</p>

<p>4. His distinction between an assembly of the whole people and an assembly
of a part of the people is incompatible with the definition of Laelius.</p>

</div>

<p>Concilium is comparatively rare in Cicero’s works. In a few
cases he seems to make concilia include all kinds of organized
national gatherings; cf. <i>Rep.</i> vi. 13 (3). 13: “Nihil est enim illi
principi deo ... acceptius quam concilia coetusque hominum
iure sociati, quae civitates appellantur (Nothing is more agreeable
to the Supreme Being than assemblies and gatherings of
men which are joined in societies by law and which are called
states”); <i>Fin.</i> iii. 19. 63: “Natura sumus apti ad coetus, concilia,
civitates.” In the first citation concilium must, and in the
second it may, include all the citizens. Cicero could hardly
mean that we are by nature adapted to assemblies of a part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
the people, or that nothing could be more satisfactory to the
Supreme Being than the concilium plebis which interdicted him
from fire and water. In <i>Fin.</i> ii. 24. 77 (“To me those sentiments
seem genuine which are honorable, praiseworthy, and
creditable, which may be expressed in the senate, before the
people, and in every gathering and concilium”) he could not be
thinking simply of the plebeian assembly, for he placed far
greater value on the opinions expressed in and by the comitia
centuriata.<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></p>

<p>From all that has been said it is evident that Cicero’s usage
as well as Sallust’s does not differ from that of Livy. In fact
no variation can be found in all the extant literature of the republic.<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>
But it may be asked whether there was not a juristic
tradition separate from the literary and preserving from early
time the true distinction between the two words under discussion.
A negative answer is compelled by the fact that history
had its origin with jurisprudence in the pontifical college, that
from the beginning historian and jurist were often united in the
same person.<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> Hence the juristic usage was the same as the
literary. It is thoroughly established, therefore, that in the late
republic, as well as in the early empire, the distinction between
comitia and concilium was not a distinction between the whole
and a part; in fact, it becomes doubtful whether the definition
of Laelius was known to the writers of this period.</p>

<p>The results thus far reached are of great importance; the
definition of comitia and concilium formulated by Laelius has
been set aside, and the ground prepared for the establishment
of new definitions by induction. From the material afforded
by the authors under discussion, the following conclusions
relative to the general uses of the two words may be drawn:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>I. (<i>a</i>) The phrases comitia curiata, comitia centuriata, comitia
tributa constantly occur; whereas (<i>b</i>) the phrases concilium
curiatum (or -tim), concilium centuriatum (or -tim), concilium
tributum (or -tim) cannot be found.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The former is too well known to need illustration; (<i>b</i>) the
latter may be sufficiently established by an examination of the
references for concilium given in this chapter.</p>

<p>II. (<i>a</i>) Concilium may apply to a non-political as well as
to a political gathering; (<i>b</i>) comitia is wholly restricted to the
political sphere.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Concilium is non-political in Cicero, <i>Div.</i> i. 24. 49 (deorum
concilium); <i>Tusc.</i> iv. 32. 69; <i>N. D.</i> i. 8. 18; <i>Off.</i> iii. 5. 25; 9.
38: <i>Senec.</i> 23. 84; <i>Fin.</i> ii. 4. 12 (virtutum concilium); <i>Rep.</i> i.
17. 28 (doctissimorum hominum in concilio); <i>Sest.</i> 14. 32 (applied
to the meeting of a collegium); Livy i. 21. 3 (Camenarum
concilia); ii. 38. 4; xxvii. 35. 4.<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p>III. Within the political sphere, again, (<i>a</i>) concilium is the
more general term,—it suggests neither organization nor lack
of organization; whereas (<i>b</i>) comitia is restricted to the organized
assembly.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Concilium is the more general term in Cicero, <i>Fin.</i> iii. 19.
63; ii. 24. 77; <i>Rep.</i> vi. 13 (3). 13.<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> In all these citations concilia,
denoting assemblies of the whole people, must certainly
include organized meetings, without excluding the unorganized.
In <i>Leg.</i> iii. 19. 42 (“Invito eo qui cum populo ageret, seditionem
non posse fieri, quippe cui liceat concilium, simul atque intercessum
turbarique coeptum sit, dimittere”) concilium is probably
the organized assembly. On the other hand, the concilium of
all the people mentioned by Livy, i. 8. 1, may have been
unorganized.</p>

<p>IV. Within the province of organized national gatherings,
on the other hand, (<i>a</i>) comitia is the wider term, applying as
it does to all assemblies of the kind, whatever their function;
whereas (<i>b</i>) concilium as an organized national assembly is
wholly restricted to legislative and judicial functions.<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Comitia is used in its most general sense in Cicero,
<i>Div.</i> i. 45. 103; ii. 18. 42 f.; 35. 74; <i>Tusc.</i> iv. 1. 1.<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>V. (<i>a</i>) Applied to foreign institutions, comitia always designates
electoral assemblies; (<i>b</i>) as at Rome, concilia are
always legislative or judicial assemblies.<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></p>

<p>VI. In the Roman state, in a great majority of cases comitia
are electoral assemblies; in fact, the word may generally be
understood to signify that kind of assembly, or simply elections,
unless the context indicates a different meaning.</p>

</div>

<p>As these lists are nearly exhaustive, they represent substantially
the relative frequency of the two uses of comitia.</p>

<p>VII. (<i>a</i>) Rarely is either the centuriate assembly or the so-called
patricio-plebeian tribal assembly termed concilium; (<i>b</i>)
the plebeian tribal assembly is rarely termed comitia except
when electoral.</p>

<p>The principal instances of the rare use of concilium under
(<i>a</i>) are Livy i. 26. 5; 36. 6; iii. 71. 3; vi. 20. 11.<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> (<i>b</i>) In its
legislative or judicial capacity the plebeian tribal assembly is
called comitia in Cicero, <i>Leg.</i> iii. 19. 45; <i>Sest.</i> 51. 109; Livy
iii. 13. 9; 17. 4; vi. 36. 9; xxv. 4. 6; xxxiv. 2. 11; xlv. 35.</p>

<p>This classification covers without exception all the cases in
the authors under discussion. An attempt may now be made
to trace the development of these uses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>The first thing to be considered is that whereas concilium is
singular, comitia is plural. Undoubtedly it is a plural of the
parts of which the whole is composed; in other words, the
curiae, or centuries, or tribes were originally thought of as little
assemblies, whose sum total formed the comitia. Comitia therefore
always has reference to the parts—the voting units—of
which the assembly is composed, whereas concilium as a singular
views the assembly without reference to its parts. For this
reason, whenever it is advisable to add a modifier to indicate
the kind of organization of the assembly, comitia is always used.
We find, accordingly, comitia curiata, comitia centuriata, and
comitia tributa in common use, but never concilium curiatum
(or -tim), concilium centuriatum (or -tim), or concilium tributum
(or -tim). These last expressions, which are modern inventions,
do not accord with the Roman way of viewing the assemblies.
This consideration satisfactorily explains the first general use.<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p>As a non-political gathering is not made up of groups—similar
to the voting divisions of the national assemblies—it cannot
be called comitia. Concilium is the only term appropriate
to it; hence we have the second general use of the two words.<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></p>

<p>The same consideration makes concilium the more general term
within the political sphere; the assembly it designates may be
organized or unorganized, whereas comitia applies only to assemblies
organized in voting divisions. This is the third general use.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a></p>

<p>For explaining the four remaining uses it is necessary to inquire
into the fundamental meaning of concilium. Although
the etymology is uncertain, probability favors the ancient conjecture
which derives it from “con-calare.”<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> People could only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
be called together for a purpose, which would most naturally
be conversation, discussion, deliberation. Whatever may have
been its origin, concilium certainly developed this meaning.<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>
In the manuscripts and editions it is frequently interchanged
with consilium,<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> and in the sources these two words are often
placed in punning juxtaposition.<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> Possibly their close resemblance,
founded on no etymological connection of the roots,
helped create in concilium the idea of deliberation. At all
events in the prose authors of the period under discussion this
is the primary meaning. The deliberative character of most
non-political concilia is very evident.<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> With this meaning the
word could not designate an electoral assembly, which did not
allow discussion;<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> it was restricted to legislative and judicial
assemblies, in which the voting was preceded by deliberation.
This is the fourth use.<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

<p>Rarely did a Roman writer have occasion to mention an
election in a foreign state. Whenever he did so, however, he
always used comitia. Most of the business of foreign assemblies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
referred to by Roman writers was concerned with
international affairs—was legislative—and hence foreign
assemblies are usually termed concilia.<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> This consideration
accounts for the fifth general use.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a></p>

<p>The sixth<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> may be easily explained. The tendency was to
restrict comitia to electoral assemblies, just as concilium was
restricted to legislative and judicial assemblies, though this
tendency never became a rule.</p>

<p>The seventh<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> may be accounted for by the fact that after the
passing of the Hortensian Law, the centuriate comitia came to
be almost wholly electoral, while the plebeian tribal gathering
became the chief statute-making body in the state. Furthermore
the assembly over which the tribunes presided was far
more deliberative than any other. Hence the centuriate assembly
became <i>the</i> comitia, and the plebeian tribal assembly <i>the</i>
concilium.<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

<p>The cause of the error into which Laelius<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> fell is now apparent.
Finding the plebeian tribal assembly frequently termed
concilium and the centuriate assembly of the whole people
generally termed comitia, he hastily concluded that comitia
should be restricted to assemblies of the whole people and
concilia to assemblies of a part of the people. This discussion
has proved, against Laelius, that for the republic and for
the age of Augustus the distinction between the two words was
not a distinction between the whole and a part, and that all the
uses of comitia and concilium in this period may be explained
by two simple facts: (1) that whereas concilium is singular,
comitia is plural; (2) that concilium suggests deliberation,
discussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>A result of this inquiry is to banish the expressions “concilium
tributum plebis” and “patricio-plebeian comitia tributa”—the
former as impossible, the latter as unnecessary—from
the nomenclature of Roman public law. There were but three
forms of organized assembly—curiate, centuriate, and tribal—all
equally entitled to the name “comitia.” The difference
between the “comitia tributa populi” and “comitia tributa
plebis” was chiefly in the presidency, as will be shown in a
later chapter.<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> Contio, on the other hand, denotes the listening
or witnessing assembly, unorganized or organized but never
voting, whereas concilium, overlapping contio and comitia, may
include voting in addition to deliberation.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CONTIO</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Contio, derived from conventio,<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> originally signified “a coming
together,” “a meeting” of any kind. In an early stage of
its history it must have been a general term for public assembly,
especially comitia. This meaning appears most clearly in a
passage of Macrobius,<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> in which, quoting the treatise of Lucius
Julius Caesar on the Auspices, he declares (1) that on market
days a contio cannot be called, (2) in other words, that on such
days business cannot be transacted with the people, (3) that for
this reason the Romans cannot hold comitia on market days.
Cicero,<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> too, states with reference to a certain market day that
“for two days no contio can be held”—for the day of the
market and the one following. From the context it is evident
that he, like Macrobius, is thinking of comitia, which, as is well
known, could not legally meet on market days.<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> Doubtless
in the conservative nomenclature of the pontiffs and augurs,
quoted by Macrobius and Cicero, contio still included comitia;
it must in fact have applied more particularly to the formal,
voting assembly; for informal meetings were not forbidden on
such days.<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> But in the time of Cicero this use of the word was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
obsolete excepting in the archaic formulae of the sacerdotal
colleges. In the political language of his age contio had come
to be restricted to the non-voting assembly—either organized<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>
or more commonly unorganized—summoned by a magistrate
or a sacerdos,<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> and in this sense it will be used in the present
volume. Still farther removed from its origin is the meaning
“oration” delivered to the people in such a gathering.<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<p>Because of the passive character of this form of assembly the
magistrate admitted all who wished to attend, without inquiring
whether they were citizens and in full possession of their
political rights.<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> It might be composed either of soldiers<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> or of
civilians, presided over in the field by the commander, in the
city by any magistrate who had a right to hold comitia in their
own or in another’s name, including the king,<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> interrex, dictator,
master of horse, and tribunes of the plebs;<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> also the quaestors<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
and aediles,<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> the pontifex maximus and the rex sacrorum.<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>
Necessarily the right belonged as well to all extraordinary
magistrates, as the decemviri legibus scribundis, who possessed
consular power within the city.<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> But promagistrates and any
others who held an exclusively military imperium could summon
neither the comitia nor the civil contio.<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> The censors held
contiones for the taking of the census,<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> for imposing fines,<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> and
for the lustration. In the last-named function the assembly
was also called comitia centuriata or exercitus urbanus.<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> The
quaestors, the curule aediles, and the plebeian aediles exercised
their jurisdiction in contiones and comitia, which for this purpose
they called not in their own name but by permission of a
higher magistrate.<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a></p>

<p>As the contio did not, like the comitia, theoretically include
all the people, any number of magistrates could simultaneously
hold meetings of the kind.<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> A minor officer had no right to
take charge of, or to summon the people from, a contio called
by another. A higher officer exercised this right against a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
lower; the consul, for instance, could take the meeting from
the hands of any ordinary patrician magistrate,<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> though not of a
tribune of the plebs. No one dared disturb a meeting of any
kind under the presidency of the latter,<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> and at least in the late
republic a tribune sometimes forbade a patrician magistrate to
address an assembly;<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> but otherwise consuls and plebeian
tribunes might hold simultaneous contiones.<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the contio was summoned merely to witness a public
act. The consuls called the people together outside the walls
by the sound of the war-trumpet to see an execution for treason.
On this occasion the citizens were arrayed in centuries on the
Campus Martius, in an assembly called at once comitia centuriata
and contio.<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> We hear of a similar execution of an astrologer
or magician outside the Esquiline gate, according to a primitive
custom;<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> and it was most probably in a contio that the supreme
pontiff scourged to death a man who had wronged a Vestal.<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>
The people gathered in the same kind of meeting to witness an
oath,<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> a judicial process,<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> or the levy of a fine.<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> But it was
preëminently the listening assembly, hence the definition offered
by Gellius,<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> “To hold a contio is to address the people, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
calling on them for a vote.” It applied not only to the isolated
meeting summoned to hear edicts, reports, communications of
every kind, including arguments and appeals for or against a
given policy,<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> but also to the preparatory stage of the voting
assembly whether addresses were delivered or not. Occasionally
in early times there was speaking on the merits of candidates
at the opening of an electoral assembly, and the voting
was sometimes interrupted for the purpose.<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> Before the age of
Cicero this rare proceeding had disappeared. In his day the
canvass for candidates had been made before the holding of the
preliminary contio, which accordingly was brief and formal.
Because much time was required for the voting of the centuries,<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>
speaking on the day of their assembly had to be minimized.
For this reason the contio for advising the adoption of a resolution
by the comitia centuriata was held on an earlier day. Such
was the meeting summoned in the Campus Martius by the consul
P. Lentulus for the purpose of urging the people to vote in
the ensuing centuriate assembly for the recall of Cicero.<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> In
judicial proceedings before any of the assemblies the testimonies
of witnesses and the pleadings occupied the greater part of the
time, and for this reason judicial assemblies were frequently
termed simply contiones. They will be described in a later
chapter.<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a></p>

<p>Informal contiones could be called at any time while the sun
was up,<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> with or without<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> an interval between the summons
and the meeting, and in any place<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> at the pleasure of the person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
who convoked them. In public assemblies of every kind the
people remained standing throughout the session.<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> The magistrate
who was about to summon an auspicated contio repaired to
the templum which he intended to occupy during the meeting.<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>
After taking the auspices there, and finding the omens favorable,
he ordered the crier to call the citizens.<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> His directions to this
assistant were prefaced by a solemn wish that the gathering of
the citizens might be well, fortunate, auspicious, and advantageous
to the Roman people, the commonwealth, himself, his
colleague or colleagues, and his magistracy.<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> After first issuing
the summons from the templum the crier repeated it while
making the circuit of the walls.<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> Meantime the presiding officer
invited the senators, his colleague or colleagues, and the various
other magistrates to assist him with their presence and advice.<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>
The invitation was extended even to opposing tribunes;<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> and on
the other hand a presiding tribune was especially anxious to secure
the presence and favorable influence of patrician magistrates
and of the leading men of the state.<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> When the president
saw his friends about him and the people gathered, he called
the contio to order,<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> and proceeded to open the meeting with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
prayer.<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> In the case of a resolution to be brought before the assembly
the magistrate was accustomed first to submit it to the
senate, which considered the bill and perhaps suggested alterations;<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>
but sometimes measures were brought into the comitia
without this senatorial deliberation.<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> In the contio the presiding
officer had power to exclude or to limit discussion of his proposals.
Ordinarily he found it advantageous to instruct the
people regarding the subject on which they were to vote; and it
was for this purpose that one or more contiones were held previous
to the comitia. The right to address the people belonged
primarily to the presiding magistrate. Although the king enjoyed
the superior right, the notion that in the regal period no
private persons spoke in the assembly seems to be unwarranted.<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>
The custom of the republic prescribed that the president should
grant the privilege not only to his colleagues<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> but also to all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
higher magistrates.<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> In some cases the invitation was extended
to senators<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> and to other distinguished private persons.<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> The
tribunes sometimes gave the privilege to freedmen,<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> to foreign
kings,<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> and to ambassadors.<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> The early republic did not allow
women to be present in political meetings;<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> but in time this
severity began to relax. Livy<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> represents the elder Cato as
saying that his generation permitted women to take part in
affairs of state and to interfere in contiones and comitia—evidently
an exaggeration, as the context proves that the women
referred to did not actually come into the assembly, and the
speaker intimates that custom disapproved of their doing so.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
From the time of the Gracchi they occasionally spoke in public.
Dio Cassius<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> states that Tiberius Gracchus brought his mother
and children into a contio to join their entreaties with his; and
according to Valerius Maximus<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> a tribune of the plebs required
Sempronia, sister of the Gracchi, to come forward in a similar
meeting and give her opinion on the subject under consideration.
In the year 43 some ladies attended a contio to protest against
being taxed by the triumvirs. Hortensia spoke for the complainants.<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>
It was an accepted custom that no tribune should
intercede against a measure till an opportunity had been afforded
private persons to speak for or against it.<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> When after
the victory of Pydna a tribune of the plebs had introduced a
motion to grant a triumph to Aemilius Paulus, and the debate
had been thrown open to the assembly, all for a time remained
silent, for no doubt was entertained as to its passing; but finally
Servius Galba, who as a military tribune had served under Paulus
and was his enemy, came forward and obstructed the measure
by a long harangue.<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> Although the president could, and perhaps
often did, throw the debate open to the citizens in this way,
he was not compelled to do so. The tribunician assembly was
more deliberative than any other—a circumstance which accounts
for its designation as a concilium.<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> Those invited to
speak, if citizens, had to be of good standing and not under disqualification
through a special law or usage. The rex sacrorum
was prohibited not only from holding any other office but also
from addressing an assembly.<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> The spendthrift<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> and the man
condemned for extortion<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> were likewise forbidden. When the
right was granted as a special distinction, the receiver was probably
placed thereby on a footing of equal dignity with the
magistrates.<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>The president could also compel a citizen to speak. The
holder of the imperium had a right to summon any man into a
public meeting, and order him to answer any question put to
him.<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> Tribunes of the plebs, however, who lacked the power
of summoning, exercised this coercive function against citizens
and even consuls, not through a direct right but by a usurpation,
probably based on their power to arrest and imprison.<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a></p>

<p>The president extended permission by asking a man to give
his opinion on the subject under discussion, and it was not in
good order even for a magistrate to address the assembly unless
invited, though he had ground for resentment if he was passed
over in favor of private persons.<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> When Caesar as consul, 59,
brought his agrarian bill before the comitia without the consent
of the senate and in spite of its silent disapproval,<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> he first
asked his colleague whether he had any objection to the proposal.
Bibulus offered none but declared that he would allow
no innovation during his consulship. Thereupon Caesar begged
him for support, and requested the people to join in the entreaty,
saying, “You will have the law on the sole condition
that he is willing.” Then Bibulus, answering in a loud voice,
“You will not have this law the present year, even if all of you
want it,” left the assembly. Slighting the other magistrates,
Caesar invited Pompey and Crassus to address the meeting,
though they were but senators and therefore, as contrasted with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
magistrates, merely private citizens. After Pompey had spoken
at length, commending the details of the law, Caesar asked if
he would support it against opponents, at the same time requesting
the people to beg of him this favor. They did so,
doubtless by acclamation; and Pompey, greatly flattered because
the consul and the people besought help of him, a private
citizen, promised to stand by the law.<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p>A magistrate spoke from the platform, a private person from
a lower position, presumably from one of the steps; for the
chairman to bring a private speaker upon the stage was a cause
of offence to his colleagues.<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> When the president granted an
opportunity to speak, he had a right to fix the amount of time
to be used. In the debate on the law for assigning provinces
to Caesar and Pompey, 55, the presiding tribune granted one
hour to Favorinus and two hours to Cato, both opponents of
the measure.<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> The speaker could use the time in whatever
way he pleased; a few persons by concert might waste the
whole day in trivialities, as is sometimes done in the senate of
the United States of America, so as to prevent voting on the
subject for that date. In the case above mentioned Favorinus,
doubtless for lack of real argument, exhausted his hour in
lamentation over the shortness of the time allowed him,<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> and
Cato spent his two hours on irrelevant or minor matters, merely
that he might be silenced by the president while still appearing
to have something to say. He persisted in speaking accordingly
till an officer dragged him from the rostra and ejected
him from the Forum. Even then he returned several times to
interrupt the proceedings with his shouting.<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> If the speaker
approved the measure, he might close with the words, “This
law of yours and your purpose and sentiments I praise and
most heartily approve”;<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> or more formally, “In my opinion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
this bill as presented ought to be passed, and may it prove well,
auspicious, and fortunate both to yourselves and to the republic”;<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>
or if opposed to the proposition, he might conclude
with this form of disapproval, “It is my judgment that this law
should by no means be repealed.”<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the magistrates were invited in the order of their
rank and afterward private citizens; in other cases, especially
in tribunician contiones, private persons were called first that
they might speak with perfect freedom, uninfluenced by the
opinion of their magistrates.<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> As the president had absolute
control, he could alter the usage to suit his own interest, and
could certainly reserve to himself the advantage of speaking last.<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>
It often happened that there was not enough time in one day
for the discussion of a question. In that case the magistrate
adjourned the meeting to a specified date.<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a></p>

<p>After the deliberation, or after the formality of opening the
contio which was merely preliminary to the comitia, the president
ordered the assembly to form into voting groups—curiae,
centuries, or tribes. He could say, for instance, “I order you
to take your proper places in the comitia centuriata,”<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> or more
generally, “If you think fit, quirites, move apart (into your
voting groups).”<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> At the same time he ordered the departure
of all who lacked the qualification for voting.<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> The lictors of
the magistrates with imperium and the beadle (viator) of the
tribune attended to clearing away the unqualified.<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE CALATA COMITIA</span></h3>

</div>

<p>In seeking for the origin and primitive character of the
Roman assembly we are enabled by comparative study to reach
a stage of growth far anterior to the beginnings of Roman tradition.
In its earliest known form the European popular
assembly had the following characteristics, provisionally enumerated
here, but established in the next chapter: (1) the
people who attended were the mass of freemen of a tribe,
especially the warriors; (2) they stood or sat promiscuously,
without reference to sub-tribal groups; (3) measures were proposed
by none but chiefs or nobles, generally after previous
discussion in council, the common members wholly lacking initiative;
(4) the speakers were as a rule, though not exclusively,
chieftains; (5) the vote was by acclamation, the clash
of weapons, or some similar demonstration; as a correlate of
(3) and (4) may be added, (6) sovereignty, so far as the idea
existed, resided not in the assembly, which of itself could take
no action, but in the king and chieftains, who made use of the
assembly (<i>a</i>) for the publication of news or of projects, (<i>b</i>) for
securing by their eloquence the coöperation of the tribe in a
plan already formed in council. However far developed beyond
this crude institution the comitia curiata or the comitia centuriata
of the republican period may have been, traces of all the
characteristics above mentioned may be found in the historical
Roman assembly<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>—a fact which justifies the comparative
method of approach to the subject.</p>

<p>We need not hesitate to begin with the unorganized contio as
the earliest form of Roman assembly, to which we may attach
the other features of the European gathering named above.
The first problem is to determine under what influence and for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
what purpose the gathering of the people came to be organized
in curiae. The notion that the object was primarily for voting
is groundless. The Athenians had the germ of a tribal assembly
in the division of the people by phylae on the occasion of
ostracophory<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> and of the passing of other privilegia (νόμοι ἐπ’
ἀνδρί). The organization was not in this case for the purpose
of using the tribes as voting units, but merely for bringing order
and solemnity to the proceeding. Apparently the assembly of
Alamanni was arrayed in military form for ratifying emancipations,<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>
though in the process the military companies did not
vote as units. In like manner, but for a wider range of functions,
we find at Rome the meeting of the people in curiae, less
frequently in centuries, merely for listening, for witnessing, or
for receiving purification. The circumstances that the business
of such assemblies was largely religious, and of such a character
that it must have originated in the earliest Roman times, and
that in the greater number of cases these gatherings were under
sacerdotal presidency suggest that the sacerdotes, particularly
the pontiffs, introduced the curiate organization from the army
to make their religious meetings more orderly and dignified.<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a></p>

<p>All assemblies which met under pontifical presidency for
religious purposes were called calata,<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> evidently from “calare,”
a verb which must originally have been in common use in the
sense of “to call,” but which in historical time was restricted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
the technical language of the sacerdotes.<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> In the latter connection
it designates the peculiar method of summoning used by
the pontiffs.<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> Probably, at least in earlier time, their calatores
acted as curiate lictors in convoking the calata comitia curiata,<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a>
over which they presided. In all meetings of the kind in the
regal period the people were grouped in curiae; under the
republic the centuriata comitia calata were also used for certain
purposes.<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> The usual meeting-place of the calata comitia
curiata was in front of the curia Calabra on the Capitoline Hill.<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>
With reference to their object, they may be classed as non-voting
and voting; the former were purely religious, the latter
were for the settlement of questions which were in part civil.<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>
First to be noted of the non-voting assemblies were those in
which the people gathered in comitia under the presidency of
the king,<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> in the republic under the rex sacrorum, to hear the
proclamation of the fasti. On the calends of each month a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
pontifex minor, as clerk of the college,<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> announced to them on
what day, whether the fifth or seventh, the nones would come.<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>
On the nones the king again summoned the people to hear the
calendar of the month,<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> read probably by the same pontifex
minor. This custom fell into disuse with the publication of the
calendar in the Forum, beginning in 304.<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

<p>Equally passive were those comitia calata which under the
presidency of the supreme pontiff witnessed the inauguration
of the three flamines maiores,<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> probably of the king in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
regal period, and certainly of the rex sacrorum under the republic.<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>
As warlike Mars had his shrines outside the pomerium,<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a>
his chief temple being in the Campus Martius,<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> it is a
probable conclusion that his flamen was inaugurated there—in
the regal period in some form of military assembly, under the
republic in the comitia centuriata.<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> The inaugural ceremonies
were performed by an augur;<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> in the case of the sacerdotes it
was the supreme pontiff who requested this service of him,<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a>
whereas the king could doubtless command an augur without
the coöperation of the pontiff. A closely related function was
the appointment of Vestals by lot, under the conduct of the
supreme pontiff in a public assembly, probably the calata
comitia.<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> The destatio sacrorum and the abjuration of social
rank, other acts which these comitia merely witnessed, will be
considered in connection with the transitio ad plebem and the
adrogatio.<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> The ceremonies attended to by the rex sacrorum
on March 24 and again on May 24 may have been in comitia
calata, though this is doubtful.<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a></p>

<p>Assemblies of the people were organized in curiae by the
pontiffs for the religious purposes mentioned above, while political
measures, so far as submitted to the people, continued for a
time, we may suppose, to be decided by din in contiones. But
when a desire for a more precise vote began to be felt, the
curiate organization naturally offered itself as most convenient
for the purpose. The contention that in primitive Rome, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
among other early peoples,<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> the assembly expressed its feeling
or opinion by noisy demonstration finds strong support in the
most probable derivation of suffragium, “vote,” which connects
it with frangere, fragor, “a breaking,” “crash,” “din,” “applause,”<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>
the prefix sub- expressing the dependence of the action
upon the proposal of the speaker, as in the military succlamare,
succlamatio.<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> We may well believe that even after the organization
of the assembly as comitia—that is, in curiate, centuriate,
or tribal divisions<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>—the voting within the component
groups continued for a time to be by din, as is suggested by the
phrase sex suffragia, applied to the six oldest groups of knights
in the comitia centuriata.<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> Voting by heads in large gatherings
is in fact a slow, cumbersome process, the product of a well-developed
political life. In all probability it originated in the
centuriate assembly—in which the military array facilitated
the taking of individual opinion<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>—and afterward extended to the
other comitia. This line of reasoning suggests that when in the
regal period a desire began to be felt for a more precise vote,
and the curiate organization readily offered itself for the purpose,
the expedient was adopted of taking the vote of each
curia in order by din and then of deciding the question at issue
by a majority of the thirty curial votes.<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> There can be little
doubt that this step also was first taken by the pontiffs.</p>

<p>The testamentary calata comitia met twice a year, probably
on fixed days.<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> It has been a disputed question whether the
oldest form of testament here referred to required a vote of the
people. Rubino<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> strongly upheld the negative on the ground
(1) of analogy with the procedure in inaugurations, (2) of analogy
with other forms of testament, none of which required a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
vote, (3) of the word testamentum itself, which refers to witnessing,
(4) of the conviction that the patricians would not leave
to the popular assembly the making of private law, (5) on the
authority of Theophilus,<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> who mentions the people’s witnessing
of the testament, (6) on the statement of Gellius<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> that wills of
the kind were made “in populi contione.” Against this reasoning
may be urged (1) the analogy from the adrogatio, (2) the
analogy from the testamentary adoption, to both of which cases
the simple testament was similar, and both of which required a
vote of the people,<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> (3) the consideration that the act of witnessing
in the assembly did not necessarily exclude a vote, (4) the
statement of Gaius<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> that calata comitia were convoked “for
making”—not for witnessing—testaments, (5) the circumstance
that the contio was often a preliminary stage of the
voting assembly<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> in addition to the fact that pontifical language
applies the term to comitia in general.<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> These arguments offset
all the points offered by Rubino, unless it be the fourth,
which is a purely subjective consideration. Arguments (1), (2),
and (4) are especially effective for establishing the fact of a
vote in the case under consideration. But the problem can be
most satisfactorily solved (6) by comparative investigation. In
the constitution of the early Indo-European family the estate
belonged jointly to all the male members, and for that reason
could not be given away by the pater.<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> The primitive Germans
accordingly made no wills, but left their property to their children,
or in failure of children to the near kin.<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> In Attica the
right to bequeath was instituted by a law of Solon, which
allowed it to those only who had no legitimate sons;<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> in Sparta<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
the right was introduced by Epitadeus, perhaps early in the
fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> Testaments were unknown in Gortyn at
the time when the <i>Twelve Tables</i> of this city were published,<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a>
and similar conditions existed in other states of Greece.<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> The
rule holds, too, for ancient India.<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> The Slavic householder
could not alienate his land without the consent of the community.<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a>
As there is no reason to assume a more advanced condition
for primitive Rome, we may conclude that, as indicated
above, the calata comitia not only witnessed but ratified testaments.<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a></p>

<p>Mommsen has attempted to fix these days as March 24 and
May 24,<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> on which the rex sacrificulus performed comitial
ceremonies not clearly described by the sources.<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> He admits,
however, that the testamentary comitia met under the pontifex
maximus rather than under the rex sacrorum<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a>—a fact directly
opposed to his contention. We should be surprised also to find
the testamentary days so close together.<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> But the most effective
argument against his view is that this function performed by
the rex sacrorum could not have been the holding of comitia, for
the time during which it continued was nefas.<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> The ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
authorities state that “the sacrificial king, after performing
sacred rites, comes into, or makes a sacrifice in (venit or litat),
the comitium,”<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> but they do not mention an assembly; hence we
may infer that in the fasti for these days reference is to some
other function than the holding of comitia. The form of testament
above described fell early into disuse,<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> so that the conditions
and ceremonies attending it became a subject of study for
antiquarians.</p>

<p>Adoptions ordinarily came before the praetor. The legal
object was the perpetuation of the family and its religion. The
law granted the privilege accordingly to those only who had no
children and who were incapable of having children. It required
further that the act should not imperil the continuance of the
family from whom the adopted came.<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> Adrogatio was the
adoption of a person who was his own master and who accordingly
consented to pass under the paternal power of another.
The word signifies that the act to which it applies required
a vote of the people.<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> It was not undertaken rashly or without
careful consideration.<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> The persons concerned were required
first to present the case to the college of pontiffs, who took into
account “what reason any one has for adopting children, what
considerations of family or dignity are involved, what principles
of religion are concerned.”<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> The age of the man who wished
to arrogate was considered—whether in this respect he was
capable of having children of his own, and care was taken that
the property of the arrogated person should not be insidiously
coveted.<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> The adrogator was asked whether he wished the
candidate for adoption to be his real son, and the candidate was
asked whether he would allow himself to be placed in this condition;<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>
and the testimonies were confirmed by an oath formulated
by Q. Mucius Scaevola.<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>If the pontiffs gave their consent, the case came before the
comitia curiata under the presidency of the chief of the college,<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
who put the question in the following form: “Do you wish and
order that L. Valerius be the son of L. Titus by the same legal
rights as if born of the father and mother of that family, and
that the latter have the power of life and death over the former
as a father over a son? This order I request of you, Romans,
to grant, just as I have pronounced the words.”<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> The curiae
decided by vote.<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> At the same meeting the arrogated son was
required to declare that he forsook the religion of the family or
gens of his birth—detestatio sacrorum<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a>—and by a similar
declaration the adrogator received him into the sacra of the
new family.<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> This form of adoption could not apply to youths
before they had put on the manly gown, or to wards or women;
for children and women had no part in an assembly, and guardians
were not allowed under any circumstances to place their
wards in the power of another.<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

<p>A modification of adrogatio is testamentary adoption, of
which the only well-known case is that of Octavius, the heir
of the dictator Caesar. Octavius came before a praetor with
witnesses and formally accepted the inheritance;<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> afterward he
was declared adopted by a vote of the curiae.<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> As this case is
nearly akin to the adrogatio, there can be no doubt that the vote
was taken in the calata comitia under pontifical presidency.<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>Distinct from the adrogatio, though analogous to it, was the
direct passing of individuals and of gentes from the patrician
to the plebeian rank—transitio ad plebem. The motive was a
desire to qualify for the tribunate of the plebs,<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> or more generally
to widen the range of one’s eligibility to office.<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> The history
of the republic affords several instances of the transition of
individuals;<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> and two plebeian gentes, the Octavia<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> and the
Minucia,<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> boasted of having passed over from the patricians.
Even if these boasts rest upon genealogical falsifications,<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> the
Romans thought such an act legally possible; and they formulated
a process applicable to every case whether of individuals
or of gentes. It was through some other ceremony than the
adrogatio, for the latter could not apply to groups of persons.
Clodius was following the more general procedure here referred
to when in the year 60 he tried to make himself a plebeian without
recourse to adrogatio. First he abdicated his nobility by an
oath, probably taken in the comitia calata;<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> then coming before
an assembly of the plebs, he held himself ready to receive
plebeian rights through a resolution introduced by the tribune
Herennius.<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> The process allowed the retention of the name,
sacra, and all other privileges not dependent on the patriciate.<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
But Metellus, the consul, objected that a curiate law was needed
to make the act valid, and the senate evidently agreed with him.<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a>
Metellus may have had in mind the transition through the
adrogatio, which required a curiate law, or more probably he
was thinking of a vote of the curiae in addition to the other
formalities which Clodius was passing through.<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> The complete
process accordingly would have been the abjuration of the patriciate,
confirmed by a curiate law, and the reception of plebeian
rights through a plebi scitum. Clodius was not so foolish as to
suppose that a process of transitio invented by himself would
prove acceptable to the senate and magistrates, and must therefore
have followed as closely as possible the formula which he
believed to be legal. But when Metellus raised the objection,
and when the tribunes persisted in interceding against the plebi
scitum,<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> he yielded for the present, and in the following year
had himself arrogated by a plebeian named Fonteius, from whom
he was forthwith emancipated.<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> This procedure, too, allowed
him to retain the gentile name of his birth,<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> his imagines and
sacra,<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> and consequently his inheritance. The oath taken in the
calata comitia accordingly was not the detestatio sacrorum usual in
arrogations, but a form of declaration which reserved these privileges,
with the understanding that in this case the arrogatio was
not for the customary object but to enable him to change his rank.<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>Analogous to the transitio ad plebem is the elevation of a
plebeian to the patrician rank. The Romans believed that
eminent plebeians, including foreigners of distinction newly
admitted to citizenship, were sometimes granted the patriciate
not only through the regal period but also in the opening years
of the republic. For the republican age they represented
the bestowal as a double act, a resolution of the people followed
by coöptation into the senate.<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> In stating that the first consuls
chose the best men from the commons, made them patricians,
and with them filled the senate to the number of three hundred,
Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> apparently has in mind the consuls’ function of
recruiting the senate before the Ovinian legislation,<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> together
with their initiative in granting the patriciate. The Roman
view that the bestowal required a vote of the people is further
proved by the procedure of Julius Caesar and of Octavianus in
creating new patricians; for in this function they doubtless
followed tradition as nearly as possible. In 45 a plebi scitum,<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a>
proposed by L. Cassius Longinus and supported by a senatus
consultum,<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> empowered Caesar to recruit the patrician rank.
Octavianus proceeded in a similar manner except that a consular
law,<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> approved also by a senatus consultum,<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> was passed
for the purpose. As the object was religious, we may suppose
that the qualifications of the candidates were previously examined
by the pontifical college. On the analogy of the transitio<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
ad plebem it may be assumed further that the candidate abjured
his plebeian rank in the calata comitia, which then confirmed
his declaration by vote.<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a></p>

<p>But whether the Romans were right in supposing patricians
to have been created in the early republic has been doubted.
Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> takes the ground that when the curiae ceased
to be exclusively patrician, elevation to the rank became impossible,
and that therefore no cases of the kind occurred after the
fall of the kings. But in such a matter it is absurd to speak of
impossibilities; everything was possible which the governing
power approved, and the argument falls when its basis, the
purely patrician state, has been removed.<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> The cessation was
in fact due to the growing exclusiveness of the patricians, who
as they came to supplant the king in the government, learned
to value their privileged position so highly they were unwilling
longer to share it with others. Just when the closing of their
rank was effected has not been ascertained, but there is no good
reason for rejecting the Roman view that for a time after the
fall of the kings plebeians continued to be admitted: in reality
the indications are strong for a relatively late closing.<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a></p>

<p>We may next inquire how patricians were created in the
time of the kings. As the history of the regal period is in
general a reconstruction with material drawn from later time, so
in this particular case ancient writers sometimes date back to
the age of the kings the usage of the republic. Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a>
accordingly states that “the Romans by vote transferred Servius
Tullius from the plebeian to the patrician order, just as they
had previously transferred Tarquin the Elder and still earlier
Numa Pompilius.” But the Romans preferred to reconstruct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
the process on an entirely different principle. Regarding the
kings as the founders of all the fundamental institutions, the
patricians looked upon their superior rank as a gift of these
monarchs. The patriciate depended upon senatorial membership,
which was at the disposal of the kings.<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> This view is well
adapted to explain the creation of the senate; but for the period
after its establishment Livy<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> adds to the adlectio of the king a
coöptatio by the patres (senators). Livy’s account of the usage
here given is reasonable; the king indicated his preference as
to the choice of advisers, but a powerful council, such as the
senate must have been, at least in the later regal period, would
have the final decision on the question of admitting a new
member. The conclusion is that toward the end of the monarchy,
if not from the beginning, plebeians were admitted to the
senate, and through it to the patriciate, by the coöperation of the
king and the senate, the people having nothing to do with
the matter.<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> But after the overthrow of the monarchy the vote
of the people was substituted for the will of the king, coöptation
by the senate continuing as before.<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a></p>

<p>The patriciate was acquired not only through bestowal by the
state, but also through the adoption of a plebeian into a patrician
family. Several cases of the kind have been ascertained.<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> The
act took place before the praetor<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> and did not concern the
comitia. Probably a preliminary examination by the pontiffs
was necessary to adoptions as well as to arrogations.<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The primitive European assembly, of which the Roman is
a variety, may be reconstructed in broad outline by a comparison
of the forms and functions of the institution as found among
the earliest Italians, Greeks, Celts, Germans, Slavs, and kindred
peoples, among whom it differed in detail while possessing the
same general features. The usual tendency of development was
toward the abridgment of popular powers to the advantage
of the nobles or of the king;<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> but in some instances may be
discovered a growth in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Generally the assembly did not have fixed times of meeting
but convened only when called by the king or chiefs. This is
known to be true of the Homeric Greeks,<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> of the Slavs,<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> and
of the Romans,<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> and may be regarded as the more primitive
condition. In addition to extraordinary sessions the German
assembly acquired the right to meet regularly twice a month at
fixed times<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a>—a right which gave the people a valuable political
advantage. In like manner the Lacedaemonians met once a
month;<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> the Athenians probably once a prytany (tenth of
a year) after Cleisthenes, and certainly four times a prytany
after Pericles.<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> The Celtic assemblies convened annually or
triennially at fixed seasons.<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> Among all these peoples, however,
subjects for consideration were presented by none but the king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
or chief, the assembly itself being wholly without initiative.
Such subjects were as a rule previously discussed in a council
of chiefs or nobles.<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> The person who summoned the assembly
naturally made the first speech, which explained the purpose of
the meeting and the character of the subject to be considered.
If it was an enterprise in which he desired the support or
coöperation of the community, he attempted to rouse for it the
enthusiasm of his hearers.<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> The discussion might then be continued
by the chiefs or any others distinguished for age, military
prowess, or eloquence.<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> Among the Germans, who possessed
more than the average degree of liberty, any one spoke who
could gain a hearing; in the Homeric assembly a commoner
who dared lift up his voice against king or noble was liable to
severe chastisement as a disorderly person;<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> and conditions
at Rome, as well as in Etruria,<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> seem to have been equally
unfavorable to the ordinary freeman.</p>

<p>A considerable variety of business came before the assembly.
It might be summoned to hear the announcement of news of interest
to the community,<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> the reading of the calendar for the
month,<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> the declaration of a policy or opinion by a king or chief,<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a>
or for witnessing acts affecting the interests of the community.<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
More important were judicial cases,<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> questions of war and peace,<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a>
and elections.<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a></p>

<p>The problem as to the relative power of the king and council
on the one hand and of the assembly on the other is difficult.
It was a disadvantage to the people, over and above their lack
of initiative, to have no means of precisely expressing their will.
The Greeks signified their approval by acclamation,<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> the Germans
by clashing their weapons,<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> and the Celts by both;<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> either
demonstration aimed to express, not the will of the majority,<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a>
but the intensity of conviction on the part of the assembly as a
whole. It lacked as well the means of legally enforcing its
will.<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> The Achaeans in assembly approved the petition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
Chryses, a suppliant priest; nevertheless King Agamemnon
rejected it.<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> After the people had divided the spoils of war,
Agamemnon seized the prize they had given another.<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> The
Trojans were ready to surrender Helen for the sake of peace;
but Priam, to gratify his son, refused, and the war went on.<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> In
his relations with individuals the king often acted unjustly and
tyrannically. Even in affairs which concerned the entire community
he might take large liberty. Without consulting the assembly
he could count on the support of the people in a war of
defence. Treaties of peace, which were often guest-friendships
and intermarriages between royal families,<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> did not come before
the people for ratification as a right, but only in cases in which
their pledge seemed necessary for the prevention of private
warfare. The right of the magistrate to conclude peace with
or without discussion in the council or senate was recognized by
the states of Italy as late as the Second Samnite war.<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> The king
might even declare an offensive war on his own responsibility,
if without consulting the people he could feel sure of their support.<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a>
Enterprises requiring their coöperation he usually submitted
to them to win their approval, as he had no means of
coercing the entire community. His independence of the assembly
increased with the growth of heredity. The idea of
sovereignty, strictly speaking, was unknown to primitive times;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
yet so far as people thought of political power, they assigned it
to the king and council.<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> Nevertheless the fact of the assembly’s
existence and the need of eloquence for persuading it prove it to
have been a real force. The suppression of the German assembly
or the prohibition of carrying arms to the meeting was
looked upon as intolerable tyranny.<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> For the disturbance of an
Irish assembly the penalty was death.<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> Public opinion was a
check on royalty,<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> and in extreme cases the people rebelled and
killed their king.<a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a></p>

<p>The strengthening of the kingship naturally tended to weaken
the assembly. The Lacedaemonian kings had a right to make
war on whatever state they pleased, and any citizen who obstructed
this power was accursed;<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> if, too, in anything the people
gave a wrong decision, the kings and council could set it
right.<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> Under the Frankish monarchy the general assembly
seems to have entirely disappeared in the sixth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, to
be revived in the latter part of the seventh,<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> in a form which
took little account of the commons.<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> In the other Germanic
tribes which entered the Empire the effect of the migration was
to strengthen the king and to weaken in a corresponding degree
the power of the people.<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> In Russia Tartar domination, converting
the legitimate princes into tyrants, effected the downfall of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
the assemblies.<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> The building up of large states, too, necessarily
degrades or destroys popular gatherings.<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a></p>

<p>The heritage of the Roman assembly from the earlier tribal
time must have been slight as well as vague—a heritage diminished
further by the growing power of the king and nobles.
The assumption has often been made that from the beginning
the Roman assembly was sovereign. The view rests in part,
however, on a confusion of two ideas which should be kept
distinct. In its broadest sense populus designates the state,
which is sovereign whether it expresses its will through the
king, the senate, or the popular assembly, or through the concurrence
of two or more of these elements. In interstate
relations it always has this meaning. More narrowly populus
signifies the masses of citizens in contrast with the magistrates
or with the senate.<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> In the latter sense it cannot be said that
the populus was from the beginning sovereign. The Romans
themselves of later time understood that in the regal period the
senate had the wisdom to advise, the king possessed the imperium,
whereas the people enjoyed but a limited degree of
freedom, right, and power.<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> Their condition was not liberty
but a preparation for it.<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> Their assembly, like that of other
early Europeans, had no power of initiative; it met only when
summoned by the king, and could consider those matters
only which the king brought before it. Its object must have
been chiefly to receive information and to witness acts of public
importance. In no case did the king call upon the assembly
for advice; counsel belonged exclusively to the wise elders, who
composed the senate;<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> and should he wish to instruct the people
in the merits of a proposed measure, he would himself address
them and perhaps invite the most respected senators or his most
trustworthy supporters among the private citizens to give the
masses the benefit of their wisdom.<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> In other than judicial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
assemblies the privilege of speaking must have been sparingly
granted.<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> Finally no elective or legislative act of the curiae
was valid without the authorization of the senate (patrum
auctoritas).<a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a></p>

<p>With reference to the specific rights of the assembly, Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a>
states that Romulus granted the commons three prerogatives,
(1) to elect magistrates, (2) to ratify laws, (3) to decide
concerning war, whenever the king should refer the matter to
them. Livy’s<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> stricture on the absolutism of Tarquin the
Proud implies, too, that constitutionally the assembly should
have had power to decide on peace and war. But stress should
be laid on the admission of Dionysius that probably all the
questions above enumerated, or at least those of peace and
war, were referred to the assembly at the pleasure only of the
king—that the decision of them was not a right of the people,
but a concession on the part of the sovereign.<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> Still more
important, these generalizations are in great part invalidated,
as Rubino<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> has shown, by the testimony of their authors.
When either refers to individual cases of treaty-making under
the kings, he never connects the assembly with the proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a>
It is significant, too, that the formula of treaty makes the
king the only actor, taking no account of the people.<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> Usually
peace continued merely through the lifetime of the king who
contracted it,<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> but a truce for a definite period was binding to
the end, even after his death.<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> Under the republic to the time
of the decemvirs the treaty-making power resided in the consuls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
and senate.<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> Ordinarily either a senatus consultum empowered
the magistrates to use their discretion<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> or sanctioned the agreement
when made.<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> More rarely the senate treated directly with
ambassadors from the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> The clamor of the plebeians
sometimes prevailed upon the senate to negotiate for peace;<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a>
and at other times it was merely by accident that the people
heard of the conclusion of a treaty.<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> After the decemviral
legislation the plebeian assembly of tribes slowly acquired the
right of ratification;<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> in fact it was not till the Second Samnite
war that their vote came to be essential.<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> Among the archives
devoted to treaties and alliances, accordingly, senatus consulta
and plebiscites alone are mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> The very fact that in the
later republic the ratification of treaties belonged exclusively to
the tribal assembly<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> proves that it was an acquired right of the
people; for we may set it down as a fixed principle that the
curiae and the centuries yielded none of their prerogatives to
the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a></p>

<p>As regards the right of the people to declare war a distinction
must be drawn between defensive wars, which, admitting neither
choice nor delay,<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> could not be referred to their decision, and
aggressive wars, which were in the option of the state to undertake
or avoid. Yet even in the case of offensive wars, though
the approval of the people was doubtless often sought, they
exercised under the kings and in the early republic no real right.
When the king or magistrate felt that Rome had suffered injury
from a neighboring state, he despatched an ambassador to seek
reparation. If the demand was not complied with, the ambassador,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
calling Jupiter and the other gods to witness the injustice,
added: “But we shall consult the elders in our own country
concerning these matters, to determine in what way we may
obtain justice.” When the messenger had returned to Rome
and had made his report, the king consulted the senate substantially
in these words: “Concerning such matters, differences,
and disagreements as the pater patratus of the Roman people,
the quirites, has conferred with the pater patratus of the ancient
Latins and of the ancient Latin peoples—which matters ought
to be given up, performed, discharged, but which they have
neither given up nor performed nor discharged—declare,” said
he to the senator whose opinion he wished first to obtain, “what
you think.” Then the elder thus questioned replied, “I think
the demand should be enforced by a just and pious war; and
therefore I consent to it and vote for it.” Then the rest were
asked in order, and when a majority agreed in this opinion, war
was thereby voted.<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> In all this account there is no mention of
the people; but afterward when the fetialis reached the border
of the enemy’s country, and pronounced the formula for the
declaration of war, he included a statement that the populus
Romanus had ordered it: “Forasmuch as the populus Romanus
of the quirites have ordered that there should be war with the
ancient Latins, and the senate of the populus Romanus of the
quirites have given their opinion, consented, etc., I and the populus
Romanus declare and make war on the peoples of the
ancient Latins.”<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> In this connection, as in all formulae applying
to international relations, populus means not the assembly
but the state; hence the use of the word cannot be taken as
evidence of the existence of a popular right to declare war.<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a>
Besides this formula we have in support of such a right the
general statement only of Dionysius and the implied idea of
Livy, referred to above,<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> neither of which is in itself of especial
weight. On the other hand the individual kings seem to have
been free to make war at their discretion. The fact that peace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
and war are represented as depending upon the character and
inclinations of the king<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> further establishes the real view of
the Roman historians. In a succeeding chapter<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> it will be
made clear that not till 427 did the centuriate assembly
acquire the right to declare an aggressive war; probably
not till some time afterward was this right established as
inalienable. Previous to that date the warriors, perhaps in a
contio, were occasionally called on to give their approval,
doubtless, as has been explained above,<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> to increase their
enthusiasm for the war.</p>

<p>With reference to the legislative activity of the assembly
under the kings, it is necessary to call attention to the fact that
among all peoples in the earlier stages of their growth law is
chiefly customary.<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> At the time of her founding Rome inherited
from the Latin stock, to which her people mainly belonged, a
mass of private and public customs, which, owing their existence
to no legislative power, were the result of gradual evolution.
Under such conditions, as in Homeric Greece, the king or chief
settled disputes in accordance with these usages, though in the
general belief his individual judgments came directly to him from
some god. The Homeric king received his dooms—θέμιστες—and
even his thoughts from the gods.<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> The mythical or semi-mythical
legislators of Greece, as Minos, Lycurgus, and Zaleucus,
were given their laws by revelation. In like manner
Numa, who may be considered a typical legislator for primitive
Rome,<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> received his sacred laws and institutions from the
goddess Egeria;<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> and Romulus, the first great law-giver,<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> was a
demi-god, who passed without dying to the dwelling-place of the
immortals.<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> Roughly distinguished, Romulus was the author of
the secular law, Numa of the sacred.<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> In general the Romans<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
of later time looked back to their kings, the founders of their
state,<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> as the authors not only of their fundamental laws and
institutions but even of their moral principles.<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> Doubtless the
Roman view of the ancient king is an image of the republican
dictatorship, of the extraordinary magistratus rei publicae constituendae,
of the consul freed from his various limitations;<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> but
the picture, stripped of the distinctness which came with the
gradual formulation of constitutional usage, is, as comparative
study shows, true to the primitive condition which it aims to
represent.</p>

<p>From this early conception the idea of human legislation
gradually emerged. Not daring on his own responsibility to
change a traditional usage which the people held sacred, the
magistrate found it expedient to obtain their consent to any
serious departure,<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> with a view not to legalizing the proposal,
but to pledging the people to its practical adoption. When and
how the primitive acclamation gave way to the orderly vote of the
comitia curiata cannot be ascertained from the sources.<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> After
this stage was reached, the transaction between king and people
had the following form: “I ask you, quirites, whether you will consent
to, and consider it right, that T. Valerius be a son to L. Titus
as rightfully and legally as if born of the father and mother of
the family of the latter, and that the latter have the power of
life and death over the former as a father over his son. These
(questions) in the form in which I have pronounced them, thus,
quirites, I ask you.”<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> The magistrate brought his formulated
request before the people (legem ferre), who accepted it (legem
accipere); the question (rogatio) was directed not to the assembly
as a whole but to the component citizens, who individually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
replied ut rogas, “yes,” or antiquo, “no.”<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> By this procedure
the citizens bound themselves to the acceptance of the proposition
on an oral promise, which was the strongest form of obligation
known to them. Herein is involved the fundamental idea
of lex, which was not a command addressed by the sovereign to
the people or a contract between ruler and ruled, but an obligation
which the citizens took upon themselves at the request of
the magistrate.<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> The verb iubere, which designates the people’s
part (populus iubet) in the passing of laws and resolutions, did
not originally have the meaning “to order,” which belonged to
it in the age of Cicero. Some have derived it from ius habere,
“to regard as right;”<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> others from judh, an extension of
the root ju, “to bind.”<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> In either case it seems to mean no
more than to accept or hold as right or as binding. In its widest
sense lex denotes any obligation which one party takes upon
himself on the offer of another. In this meaning it may apply
to a business contract,<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> in which alone the obligations are reciprocal,
to the instruction imposed by a superior magistrate upon an
inferior,<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> to the auspicium which the magistrate formulates and
the god accepts,<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> to the ordinance which the subject, without
being consulted, receives willingly or unwillingly from the ruler<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
(lex data),<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> as well as to the statute established by the question
of the magistrate and the affirmative answer of the citizens (lex
rogata). The leges of the community, with which alone the
present discussion is concerned, were distinguished as publicae.<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a>
A lex of the kind was not necessarily general,<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> but applied as
readily to an individual citizen<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> as to the entire body, to a declaration
of war,<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> or the banishment of a citizen,<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> as well as to a
universal rule of conduct. In the earlier time the lex rogata, or
simply lex, seems to have designated any act of an assembly,
elective or judicial as well as law-making in the modern sense.<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a>
But in the time of Cicero it had come to mean any act of an
assembly which was neither an election nor a judicial decision,<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a>
and in the latter sense the word is used in this volume.</p>

<p>The acceptance of a proposition by the citizens obligated
themselves<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> but not the government. The king, who retained
office for life and was irresponsible, could not be held amenable
to law; against a tyrannical ruler the only resource was revolution.
Although the republican magistrates possessed remarkably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
great power, as temporary functionaries they belonged to the
people, along with whom they were bound by the laws.<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a></p>

<p>To the end of the regal period the legislative activity of the
people remained narrowly restricted. The body of leges regiae,
described as curiate by Pomponius<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> on the supposition that they
were passed by the assembly under royal presidency,<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> was little
more than the ius pontificum—the customary religious law—with
whose making the curiae had nothing to do.<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> If the king
wished to admit new citizens,<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> erect public works, levy forced
labor on the citizens,<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> reform the military organization,<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> punish a
man with chains or death,<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> make a treaty, or even declare an
offensive war, no power compelled him to submit the measure to
the citizens. Although he must often have found it expedient
to engage their coöperation in national enterprises, or more
rarely in a legal innovation,<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> it may be stated with confidence
that before the beginning of the republic the curiate assembly
had not acquired the right to be consulted on any of these
matters—that its slight activity in legislation and administration
was a concession from the king rather than a right; for under
the republic such activity, gradually increasing, belonged to the
centuries and the tribes. We may accept without hesitation the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
principle that in form if not in substance the curiae retained all
the powers which they had ever actually possessed.</p>

<p>Judicial business, which no one has ever assumed to be a
primitive function of the Roman assembly, needs no long consideration
here. Among the early Indo-Europeans the settlement
of disputes and the punishment of most crimes were in the
hands of the families and brotherhoods; only treason and
closely related offences were noticed by the state; and these
cases were tried by the king in the presence of the assembly.<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a>
The religious ideas attaching to crime and punishment<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> in early
Rome suggest that the priests had the same connection with
these matters there as among the Celts and Germans. That
condition yielded to the growing authority of the king, who is
represented by the ancients as wielding an absolute power of
life and death over his people and as allowing in capital cases
an appeal to the assembly at his own discretion.<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> From the
general conception of the relation between king and assembly as
established in this chapter, it is necessary to infer that if the
people had any claim to a share in the jurisdiction, it must have
been slight as well as vague, and one which they were in no
position to enforce.</p>

<p>A review of the individual kings might give the impression
that an act of the assembly was unessential to filling the regal
office. Not only were Romulus and Tatius kings without
election,<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> but according to Livy<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> Numa’s appointment was
made by the senate alone; and Servius ruled long and introduced
his great reforms before his election.<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> Tarquin the
Proud to the end of his reign was neither appointed by the
senate nor chosen by the people.<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> From these four or five
instances of kings who ruled without election, as well as from
the fact that both the dictatorship—a temporary return to
monarchy—and the office of rex sacrorum—the priestly successor
to the monarch—were filled by appointment, we might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
infer that the kingship was not elective.<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> But on the other
hand the word interregnum, which could not have been invented
in the republican period and which involves the idea of election,
as well as the general custom of choosing kings among primitive
European peoples, may be added to the authority of
our sources<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> in favor of an elective monarchy in earliest
Rome. The nomination of the king by the competent person
was perhaps acclaimed in a contio in some such way as
among the early Germans. Such an election, we may suppose,
was in the beginning legal without further action on the
part of the people. But the accession of a king was a momentous
event in the life of a generation—far more important than
the annual declaration of war upon a neighbor—and the
advantage of a formal vote of the curiate assembly, after its
institution, was obvious both to the king and to the sacerdotes;
it gave to the former the solemn oral pledge of obedience from
the citizens, and to the latter an opportunity to influence the
proceedings through the auspices and through the manipulation
of the calendar.</p>

<p>Under this system the king after his appointment by his predecessor
or by the interrex, and after the acclamation in contio
if such action took place, convoked the curiae on the first convenient
comitial day of his reign,<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> having held favorable auspices
in the morning, and proposed to them a rogation<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> in some
such form as the following: “Do you consent, and regard it as
just and legal, that I, whom the populus has designated king,
should exercise imperium over you?” This rogation, answered
affirmatively by a majority of the curiae, became a lex curiata
de imperio.<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> The informal acclamation, if it was the custom,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
must have disappeared in time, and the passing of the curiate
law was looked upon as the election proper.<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a></p>

<p>Concessions to the people develop into popular rights. The
citizens, deeply interested in the choice of a man who for the
remainder of his life was to represent their community before
the gods, lead them in war, and exercise over them the power
of life and death, claimed as their first active political right the
ius suffragii in the passing of this lex curiata de imperio.
Hence after the institution of the republic and of the comitia
centuriata, the curiae clung obstinately to this inalienable
prerogative.<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a></p>

<p>The development of the elective process outlined above is
offered in explanation of the curious phenomenon that under
the republic, while all other acts of the centuriate and tribal
assemblies required no confirmation by the curiae, elections by
these assemblies did require such a sanction. This explanation
is the only one proposed which accords with the Roman interpretation
of the peculiarity. According to Cicero it was provided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
that in the case of all elective magistrates the people
should vote twice on each that they might have an opportunity
to correct what they had done, if they repented of having conferred
an office on any person. In the case of the censors this
second vote was cast in the comitia centuriata; all other elective
magistrates received it in the curiate assembly.<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> Rubino<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a>
and others have objected that Cicero’s interpretation of the
curiate law is biassed by his desire to contrast the essentially
antipopular character of the demagogue Rullus,<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> who by the
terms of his agrarian law would deprive the people of their
right to vote even once in the election of officials, with the wise
and moderate statesmen of old, who were so devoted to the
people as to allow them two opportunities to express their choice
in the case of each magistrate. The orator, it is urged, could
not himself know the original intention of the usage; and his
interpretation is contradicted by the fact that the person who
proposed the lex curiata was already a magistrate, the voting
on this lex being subsequent to the election and forming no
part of it.<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a></p>

<p>In favor of Cicero’s interpretation it may in the first place be
stated that he was not simply offering a conjecture as to the original
intention of the usage, but was interpreting the formula of the
law as it existed in his own day. There would be no point to
his interpretation unless the formula ran somewhat like that of
an election; and he affirms definitely that the law bestows the
magistracy upon a person who has already received the same
office from other comitia—that it is, in other words, a second
bestowal of the office.<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> That this interpretation is not a mere
invention of Cicero is proved by a statement of Messala<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
the magistracy in the strict legal sense of the term is granted
by the curiate law. And the point maintained by Messala is
further confirmed by that article of the agrarian rogation of
P. Servilius Rullus which provides that the decemviri agris adsignandis
may, if necessary, dispense with the curiate law and
yet be “decemvirs in as legal a sense as are those who hold the
office according to the strictest law.”<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> In other words, the person
who has been elected by the comitia centuriata or tributa
is a magistratus, though not a magistratus iustus or optimo iure
(optima lege); the completion of all formalities, ending with a
second election (by the curiae), is essential to the latter.</p>

<p>Optimo iure requires explanation. It often signifies “with
perfect justice,” “most deservedly.”<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> Closely related to this
meaning is that of “perfect formality,” as in making a bequest<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a>
or in creating a sacerdos<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> or a magistrate.<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> In this sense optimo
iure is interchangeable with optima lege. Developed in
another direction, either phrase readily gives the idea of completeness
or perfection of title, not only to property,<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a> but also
to office.<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> One who holds a perfect title to a property, or has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
been granted a civil status<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> or an office<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> in a perfectly legal
way, necessarily enjoys all the immunities, honors, and powers
inherent in such absolute condition. To indicate that due legality
has been observed in the creation of a magistrate, and that
the latter has accordingly complete possession of his office, and
of all the honors and powers belonging to it, the phrase ut qui
optima lege sunt, erunt is often inserted in the formula of appointment
or election. These words continued to be used, for
example, in the creation of the dictator as long as his power remained
absolute, but after it became subject to appeal, they were
dropped.<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> The author of the act was at the same time author
of the condition attaching to it expressed by the phrase under
consideration: in the appointment of a dictator it was the consul;
in the creation of a promagistrate or the assignment of a
province it might be the senate.<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> Laws must often have contained
provisions that the magistrates created under them should
be ut qui optima lege.<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> The Servilian bill most probably included
an article of the kind for the decemviri agris adsignandis
to be elected under it. But as the title to an office was
impaired by any informality in the elective process, and as
Servilius foresaw that the lex curiata might be prevented by
tribunician intercession or other cause, he inserted in his bill
a further provision, referred to above,<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> that the decemviri might
be officials optima lege<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> even without the curiate sanction.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
From what is here said it is clear that the condition of iustus
or optima lege was not obtained for a magistrate by the passing
of the curiate act alone, but rather by due attention to all formalities,<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a>
which were brought to completion by that act.</p>

<p>The formula for the curiate law, in addition to its resemblance
to that for elections, must have contained some reference to the
imperium, as we may infer from the frequent designation of the
law as a lex de imperio by Cicero. From this phrase modern
writers infer that the curiate act conferred the imperium upon
newly elected magistrates. The question whether it granted to
a magistrate powers which he did not already possess will be
considered below. For the present it is enough to state that
in no instance do the ancients speak of “conferring” the imperium
by the curiate law or of deriving the imperium from that
law by any process whatsoever. But mention is made of conferring
the imperium by a decree of the senate or by the suffrages
of the people in the centuriate or tribal assembly<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> and
of <i>confirming</i> it by the curiate law.<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>The consuls and the praetor were elected by the centuries,
and their imperium was sanctioned by the curiae. The
dictator, too, was obliged to carry a curiate law.<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> But the
quaestors, the curule aediles, and other inferior magistrates,
after their election by the tribes, did not themselves convoke
the curiae for sanctioning their election; the lex was proposed
in their behalf by a higher magistrate.<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> As the origin of this
custom we may suppose that the kings, and after them the
higher magistrates of the early republic, used to ask the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
for a pledge of loyalty not only to themselves but also to their
assistants, and that this custom continued even after they had
come to be elective magistrates. To functionaries who lacked
the imperium the expression lex de imperio could not apply;
lex de potestate, though not occurring in our sources, would
be the appropriate phrase.</p>

<p>It has generally been assumed that the curiate law bestowed
a power in addition to that received through election.<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> Something
can in fact be said in favor of this view. We are told
that the newly elected magistrate could attend to no serious
public business till he had secured the passage of the act:<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a>
till then the praetor could not undertake judicial business; the
consul could have nothing to do with military affairs<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> or hold
comitia for the election of his successor.<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> Some of Cicero’s
contemporaries asserted that a magistrate who failed to pass
the law could not as promagistrate govern a province.<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> Or if
without a curiate law he made the attempt, he would be obliged
to conduct the administration at his own expense;<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> and if as
promagistrate he gained a victory in war, he was denied a
triumph.<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> Under such conditions it might well be said that a
magistrate could engage in no serious public business before he
had carried for himself the sanctioning law. But practice
diverged widely from these rules. An act containing a provision
for the election of functionaries might include a dispensing
clause to the effect that the persons elected shall, in
the lack of a curiate law, “be magistrates in as legal a sense as
those who are elected according to the strictest forms of law.”<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a>
Yet even without this special provision the magistrate regularly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
attended to much business before passing the law. The first
public act of the consul, praetor, or other magistrate was to
take the auspices, to determine whether his magistracy was acceptable
to the gods;<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a> and another auspication was held for the
meeting of the curiae.<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> It was customary, too, for the consul
to make his vows to the Capitoline Jupiter and to hold a session
of the senate, both of which acts had to be auspicated.<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> These
facts disprove the theory that the curiate law conferred the
auspicium. In the first session of the senate here mentioned
not only religious affairs but civil and military matters of
great importance were discussed and finally arranged, all of
which business was regularly managed without a curiate law.<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a>
As to other administrative acts it is probable that the want of
a lex curiata never hindered the performance of necessary
business civil or military. In case of danger to the state
the interrex, who wholly lacked the curiate law, or the consul
before passing the law could doubtless take command of the
army;<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> and it is significant that the unlimited imperium and
iudicium were granted the magistrates not by the curiae but by
the senate.<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> The law was indeed considered indispensable to
the dictator in 310.<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> It is generally assumed by the moderns
that C. Flaminius, consul in 217, lacked the law;<a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> their reason
is the statement of Livy<a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> that he entered upon his office not
at Rome but at Ariminum. The fact, however, that in this
year he carried a monetary statute before his departure for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
the war<a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> proves that he began his official duties at Rome, and
that Livy’s tirade to the contrary is empty rhetoric. Probably
because he departed without attending to the usual auspices,
his political opponents were unwilling to admit that he had
entered on his office. But the army obeyed his command, his
name remained in the fasti as consul, and his monetary law
continued in force. Livy, while complaining at length of his
failure to take the auspices, says nothing of the curiate law.
His silence is significant.<a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> We cannot be certain that the lex
curiata was not passed in his case; but we have no right to
imagine that it was not and then draw far-reaching deductions
from our fancy.<a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a></p>

<p>A more valuable instance is that of L. Marcius, elected
propraetor by the army in Spain in 212.<a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> Although he could
not have had a lex curiata, the senate, while censuring the
election because it transferred the auspices to the camp, did
not make the want of the law a ground for declaring the
magistracy illegal.<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> A still more famous case is that of the
magistrates of the year 49, who with the Pompeian party fled
from Rome before carrying a lex curiata, and yet were not prevented
by this circumstance from holding military commands
during their year of office or from continuing in command into
the following year as promagistrates.<a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> A further instance is
that of Pomptinus, praetor in 63, who had no curiate law;
nevertheless as propraetor in 61 he governed Narbonensis
where he gained a victory over the Gauls. This fact, too, is
evidence that the want of the law did not in practice debar
from military commands. From 58 to 54 he waited outside the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
gates of Rome for a triumph. The senate would not grant it
and some of the magistrates opposed his effort to obtain it.
The privilege was at last given him by the comitia under pretorian
presidency.<a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> Although the want of the law involved
him in inconvenience, he finally accomplished his purpose without
it. Appius Claudius, consul in 54, insisted that, should he
fail to carry the sanctioning act, he should nevertheless, since he
was in possession of a province decreed the consuls of his year in
accordance with the Sempronian plebiscite, have imperium by
virtue of a Cornelian statute until such time as he should re-enter
the city.<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> The law of Sulla, to which he referred,
probably stated simply that the promagistrate was to retain
his imperium till his return to the city, without mentioning the
curiate law; and for that reason Appius believed the sanctioning
act to be unnecessary. Cicero, who informs us of this
matter, inclines to the interpretation of Appius. Our conclusion,
accordingly, is that in practice, if not in legal theory, the
lex curiata, however convenient it may have been, was not
essential to the government of a province or to a military
command. It remains to consider whether it was indispensable
to the holding of comitia centuriata for elections. The same
Appius Claudius maintained that though a curiate law was
appropriate to the consul, it was not a necessity,<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> implying
that without the law he was competent to perform all the
functions of that office. He and his colleague, therefore, who
was equally without the law,<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> were ready to hold comitia for
the election of successors; and although party complications
opposed the election, no one objected to it on the ground that
the consuls were incompetent; for postponing the election they
resorted to auspical obnuntiations<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> and to prosecutions of the
candidates for bribery.<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> Their competence to hold the elective
comitia is further established by the senate’s desire that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
should hold them at the earliest possible moment.<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> The ultimate
failure of these consuls to elect successors was not owing
to any one’s objecting to their competence.<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a></p>

<p>Scholars have attached great weight to the case of the magistrates
of 49, who with the Pompeian party, as has been stated,<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a>
left the city before carrying a lex curiata. Though desiring, in
the Pompeian camp at Thessalonica, to hold comitia for the
election of successors, it was decided that the want of the law
rendered the consuls incompetent for the function.<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> But the
case requires careful examination. The Pompeians had with
them two hundred senators, enough in their opinion to constitute
a quorum, and their augurs had consecrated a place for
taking auspices; so that it was assumed that the populus
Romanus and the entire city were now located in the camp.<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a>
All these circumstances clearly imply an intention to assume a
temporary transfer of the city of Rome to the camp and to conduct
the government in that place on the basis of this constitutional
fiction. But suddenly the execution of the plan was
stopped by the plea that the consuls had no curiate law! The
difficulty, however, was not so serious as Dio Cassius and the
moderns have supposed. The assumption of the Pompeians
that the city of Rome temporarily existed in the camp implied
as well the existence of a pomerium, within which the consuls
could legally have held a meeting of the curiae.<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> Or in case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
they felt any scruple about the matter, the senate could have
decreed the consuls a dispensation from the law for the purpose
of holding the elections. That they allowed a mere formality
to baulk them is out of the question. The whole situation
is made clear by the understanding that the consuls themselves,
or more probably Pompey, did not wish elections to be
held or a civil government established in the camp; such
a proceeding would have disturbed still further the discipline
of the army and would have roused jealousies inimical to
the cause. On this interpretation the want of a law, especially
as it has the appearance of an afterthought, was a mere
pretext.</p>

<p>We have seen promagistrates whose election to their respective
offices had not been sanctioned by the curiae governing
provinces and holding military commands; we have seen consuls
who lacked the curiate sanction attending with less inconvenience
to all their official duties. The same looseness
characterized the application of the law to minor officials. The
want of the sanction legally involved curule aediles, quaestors,
and all other officials who lacked the right to convoke the
curiae; and yet it is impossible that in 54, for instance, when
the consuls failed to pass the law, the curule aediles and the
quaestors should have remained inactive through the entire
year without leaving in our sources some trace of the disturbance
caused by the suspension of their administrative
functions. Dio Cassius states that no judicial process could
be undertaken before the enactment of the law; nevertheless
Clodius as aedile in 56 prosecuted Milo before the people prior
to the vote on the sanctioning act.<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> The quaestors entered office
regularly on December 5;<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> and as the curiate law was carried
for them by the consuls, they were necessarily in official duty
for some time every year before their election could be sanctioned.
It seems clear that ordinarily one curiate law was
passed each year, under the joint presidency of the consuls and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
praetors, for all the officials who required it.<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> If that is true, a
postponement of the law, or a failure to pass it, affected all the
magistrates of the year.</p>

<p>The question as to the meaning of this wide divergence
between constitutional theory and actual practice can find an
answer only in the history of the curiate assembly. For a time
after the founding of the republic it remained politically important.
From the institution of the plebeian tribunate (494) to
the enactment of the so-called law of Publilius Volero (471) the
curiate assembly elected tribunes of the plebs.<a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> In 390, according
to Livy,<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> it voted the restoration of a citizen from exile.
Rubino<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> maintained that this assembly continued to be a real
gathering of the people to the year after the battle of Cannae,
215, when the exigencies of the war with Hannibal brought into
being a statute whereby the curiate act was passed by a vote of
thirty lictors as the representatives of their respective curiae; in
consequence the sanction was reduced to a formality.<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> The
passage in Festus on which his theory depends is seriously
mutilated; and his attempted restoration is objectionable chiefly
(1) because it required no statute to keep the people from attending
the comitia curiata,<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> (2) because without a statute a resolution
of the assembly was valid, if each voting division was
represented by a single person,<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> (3) because the measure, accordingly,
to be a relief to existing conditions, must have freed the
commander rather than the men from the necessity of going to
Rome to enact the curiate law. Whatever may be the true
reading,<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> we have a right to infer from the extant fragment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
(1) that in the year mentioned, owing to the nearness of Hannibal,
something was done to relieve officers in the field from the
necessity of coming to Rome to propose the law for themselves,
(2) that the regulation was permanent.<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> It is known that the
consul Q. Fabius Maximus presided at the consular elections
for 214.<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> He and M. Claudius Marcellus, who as proconsul was
at the time in command of an army, were elected.<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> Down to
this time the custom had probably been for men who were
reëlected to an office or who passed from a promagistracy to the
corresponding magistracy, or the reverse, to reënact the lex
curiata. But we may suppose that after the election of 215
Fabius, fearing that both he and Marcellus might be absent on
military duty at the opening of their official year, secured the
passage of a measure, most likely a senatus consultum,<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> which
exempted from the need of repeating the curiate law holders of
the imperium who were making the transition above described.
In consenting to the arrangement the senate was making a great
sacrifice to the exigencies of the situation. For to maintain control
over the commanders it had insisted that they should begin
their terms with all due formality at Rome.<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> The lex curiata
had proved a material help to this end. But now the person
already in command might continue from year to year at his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
post, relieved of the need of coming to the capital, where he
would be temporarily subject to senatorial control.</p>

<p>This provision of 215 was therefore an important step in the
development of the imperium; and at the same time it tended
to destroy the little importance still attaching to the curiate
law. It seems to have been after this event and partly in consequence
of it<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> that the comitia curiata, which had long been
declining, became at last a mere formality, attended by none
but three augurs as witnesses to the proceedings<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> and thirty
lictors,<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> who meekly<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> cast the votes in obedience to the command
of the presiding magistrates.<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> It is a noteworthy fact
that whereas the statesman Cicero has much to say of the curiate
law, Livy and Dionysius make little reference to it. Our
conclusion must be that it was more important in the late
republic than in the earlier time. Probably it nearly fell into
disuse after 215, to be revived some time before Cicero. Its
rehabilitation was the work of the optimates, for we find the
senatorial party chiefly interested in maintaining it during the
age of Cicero. Since the lex curiata, subject as it was to
impetrative auspices and to obnuntiations, correlated closely
with the Aelian and Fufian statutes, we may reasonably connect
its revival closely with their origin. Cicero<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> tells us
accordingly that the comitia curiata have continued merely for
the sake of the auspices. The curtailment of the power of this
assembly is analogous to the curtailment of the power of the
king; as the latter was reduced, in the rex sacrorum, to a shadow
continued merely for a religious purpose, the curiate comitia
were likewise reduced to a shadow maintained in appearance
merely for keeping up an ancient custom and for the auspices
connected therewith,<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> but in reality as a part of the religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
machinery operated with more or less effect for controlling
refractory office-holders. During the age of Cicero the senate
strove to uphold its theory of the necessity of the law, while
individuals in office and even the entire group of magistrates
for the year looked upon it as appropriate indeed but unessential
to their functions. At its best the theory could be but
partially realized in practice.</p>

<p>Naturally the lictors never refused to vote the lex curiata,
but it was often prevented or delayed by the intercession of the
plebeian tribunes.<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> As we hear nothing of such action of the
tribunes in the early republic we may well conclude that it was
a late usurpation. Their veto could be offset by a special
resolution of the people for dispensing the persons elected from
the need of the curiate sanction.<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> In destroying the tribunician
power Sulla, perhaps consciously, strengthened the lex curiata
as a weapon in the hands of the senate. He did not treat the
subject, however, with his usual precision; for in 54 we find
Appius Claudius appealing to a Cornelian law in justification of
his intention to govern a province without the sanction.<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> The
procedure of Appius must have robbed the sanctioning act of
the little vitality which it still possessed. With the downfall
of the republic it fell completely into disuse.<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE ORGANIZATION OF THE COMITIA CENTURIATA</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I. <i>In the Early Republic</i></h4>

<p>From the point of view of the Roman historians the centuriate
assembly,<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> planned by Servius Tullius, came into existence
at the beginning of the republic; its earliest act in their opinion
was the election of the first consuls<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> and its earliest statute the
Valerian law of appeal.<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> Though they could not know precisely
when it voted for the first time, they were right in understanding
it to have been the basal comitia of the republic during
the patrician supremacy. It may not have been instituted till
some time after the downfall of the kingship,<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> and it certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
did not reach its full complement of a hundred and ninety-three
centuries till more than a hundred years after that event.</p>

<p>Through the early republic Rome was engaged in an almost
unceasing struggle for existence. The army was constantly in
the field; and the consuls from the praetorium issued their commands
for the protection and the government of the city. Their
measures, after discussion in the council of war, they must often
have submitted to the approval of the army. The military contio
was sometimes summoned for exhorting the men,<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> for promising
the reward of spoil in case of victory,<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> for reprimanding as well
as for encouraging.<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> On one occasion the master of horse, calling
a contio of soldiers, appealed to them for protection from
the dictator,<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> and they replied with a shout that they would allow
no harm to befall him.<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> Thereupon the dictator summoned another
contio to witness the court-martial of the rebellious officer.<a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a>
On another occasion the consuls asked the soldiers to decide a
question by acclamation, and they obeyed.<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> We hear of the
adjournment of a meeting on the motion of a military tribune.<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a>
After a victory, honors and rewards were granted by vote of the
soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> For acclamation, the regular form of voting,<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> was
sometimes substituted a division of the army to right and left
for the sake of silence.<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> A military assembly, meeting at Veii,
decided upon the appointment of Camillus, then in exile, to the
dictatorship, and despatched the resolution to Rome.<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> In the
year 357 the consul Cn. Manlius held a tribal assembly of his
troops at Sutrium, and passed in it a law which imposed a tax
of five per cent on the manumission of slaves.<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> Long afterward
the army in Spain elected a propraetor.<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a> It may be that much
other political business was decided by the army in the troublous
times which followed the overthrow of the kings. Although
such acts were valid, they were always of an exceptional nature,
and they ran counter to the spirit of the constitution, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
granted to all the citizens, not to those merely who chanced to
be on military duty, a voice in the decision of such public affairs
as came before the people.</p>

<p>It is true that the centuriate assembly, having developed from
the army, showed pronounced military features. It could not
be convoked within the pomerium, for the reason that the army
had to be kept outside the city;<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> before the reform it met ordinarily
in military array under its officers and with banners displayed;<a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a>
the usual place of gathering was the Campus Martius;
and no one but a magistrate cum imperio could under his own
auspices convoke it for the purpose of taking a vote.<a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> For these
reasons it was frequently, even in official language, termed exercitus.<a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a>
The use of this word, however, should not mislead us
into supposing that the assembly was an actual army. Though
Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a> represents the first meeting as armed—a mere supposition,
apparently to account for its known military features—the
fact is that the citizens carried weapons to none of the
assemblies.<a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> Strictly, too, the centuriate gathering was termed
exercitus urbanus in contrast with the real army designated
as exercitus armatus or classis procincta.<a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> The facts thus far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
adduced amply warrant us in refusing to consider the voting
assembly an army.</p>

<p>But some imagine the censorial assembly for the assessment
and lustration of the citizens to have been an army.<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> For
this view they rely upon Dionysius,<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a> who states that the people
came armed to the first lustrum, and upon an uncertain passage
from the Censoriae Tabulae, quoted by Varro,<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> which possibly
speaks of the citizens in the lustral assembly as armati. If
this word should be supplied in the passage, it might refer to
an inspection of arms of the men of military age;<a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> but that
circumstance would by no means imply that all who attended
the lustrum were armed or were liable to military duty. It is
certain that as the census-taking had primary reference to
property for the purpose of apportioning taxes and other burdens
of citizenship, those only were summoned who were legally
capable of holding property in their own name. The list
excluded all the men “in patris aut avi potestate,” however
liable they were to military duty,<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> as well as the women and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
children.<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> All such persons were reported by the father or
guardian. It included, on the other hand, many who were
exempt from military service on account of age, physical condition,
or want of the necessary property qualification. Hence
the censorial assembly could not have been identical with the
army. Furthermore the centuriate assembly was not a basis for
the levy.<a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a> On the contrary, the soldiers were enrolled directly
from the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> These facts warrant the conclusion that the
relation between the army and the assembly must have been
one of origin only; the organization of the assembly developed
from that of the army, but at no time was the political assembly
an army or the army otherwise than exceptionally or irregularly
a political assembly. The truth is that an army regularly
officiating as a political body would require for its explanation
two revolutions—one to bring it into existence and another to
abolish it; but of both cataclysms history is silent.</p>

<p>The growth of the political from the military organization
was somewhat as follows. After the Romans had determined
to use the centuries regularly as voting units for the decision of
questions not purely military, they proceeded forthwith to extend
the organization so as to include all the citizens. For this purpose
the men of military age who were free from duty for the
time being, or who had served the required number of campaigns—sixteen
in the infantry or ten in the cavalry<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a>—or
who were exempt on account of bodily infirmity or for any other
reason, had to be admitted to the junior centuries, thus materially
increasing their number and making them unequal with
one another. In a state, too, in which great reverence was paid
to age the seniors could not be ignored. They were accordingly
organized in a number of centuries (84) equal to that of the
juniors—an arrangement which made one senior count as much
as three juniors.<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a> The mechanics who were liable to skilled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
service in the army<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> were then grouped for voting purposes in
two centuries, that of the smiths and that of the carpenters,<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a>
based on the two guilds in which these artisans were already
organized.<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> Authorities differ as to the classes with which
they were associated. Livy<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> adds them to the first class.
Cicero,<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> too, places a century of carpenters with that group,
making no mention of the smiths, whereas Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> assigns
both centuries of mechanics to the second class. The explanation
of the difference of opinion seems to be that information
as to this point was not contained in the censorial document
from which the annalist (Fabius Pictor) drew his knowledge of
the earlier comitia centuriata; the Romans knew only by tradition
that the industrial centuries were associated in the assembly
with one of the higher classes. The weight of authority inclines
in favor of the first class, and the reason for the respectable
place occupied by the mechanics is the high value placed on
their service in early time.<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a> In like manner the trumpeters
(tubicines, liticines) and the hornblowers (cornicines) were
grouped each in a century for voting in the comitia,<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> also on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
the basis of their guild organizations.<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> The accensi velati, who
as we are informed followed the army in civilian dress and without
weapons,<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a> also received a centuriate organization. As to
the number of centuries belonging to them opinion has differed.
Some, formerly including Mommsen,<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> have assumed two. Livy,<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a>
however, gives but one century; Cicero<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> seems to have only
one in mind; and in imperial time there was a single collegium,
or century, of accensi,<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> probably a survival of the old political
group. These considerations led Mommsen to abandon his
former view, to assume instead a single century of the kind;
and recent writers are inclined to follow him.<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> Lowest in rank
of the supernumerary centuries was that of the proletarians.<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a>
The government so designated those citizens who owned no
land,<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> and hence were poor. They were exempt from military
duty, excepting in so far as they served with arms furnished by
the state.<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> Though few in the beginning, their number gradually
increased till in the time of Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> it exceeded all the
five classes together. At some time in the early history of the
comitia centuriata they were formed into a century and given
one vote,<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> which was not counted with any class but was reported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
after all the others. Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> wrongly speaks of it as a
sixth class. The existence of this century is due to the principle
that no one should be excluded from the right to vote on
account of poverty.<a id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a></p>

<p>Six supernumerary centuries have now been mentioned and
the place of three—the two industrial and the one proletarian—in
the voting system has been considered. With reference
to the others Dionysius assigns the musicians to the fourth class,
Livy to the fifth. The settlement of this question is aided by
an examination into the total number of comitial centuries of the
fifth class. It is given as thirty by the sources.<a id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a> Assuming
this to be the correct number and adding to the sum of centuries
in the five classes (170) the six supernumerary centuries and the
eighteen centuries of knights to be considered below, we should
have in all a hundred and ninety-four, which would be one too
many. In an earlier chapter, however, the conclusion was
reached that there were but fourteen military centuries in the
fifth class.<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> Two of the thirty centuries assigned to that class
In the comitia centuriata must therefore have been in fact supernumerary.
If one was the accensi, what was the other? Most
probably it was the century of the tardy described by Festus,<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a>
made up at each meeting of those who came too late to vote in
their own classes. Obviously all writers who apply the discriptio
centuriarum to the army view this century, as well as that of
the proletarians, with suspicion.<a id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> The two centuries of the
accensi and the tardy should be included among, not added to,
the thirty of the fifth class.<a id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> Having reached this result, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
might seem advisable for us to assume no further supernumerary
centuries for the fifth class, but to follow the authority of Dionysius
in assigning the musicians to the fourth. Or as the trumpeters
preceded the hornblowers in rank, it might be plausibly
argued that the former belonged to the fourth and the latter to
the fifth. In this way a compromise could be effected between
Livy and Dionysius, and Livy’s three supernumerary centuries
of the fifth class could be explained. Absolute certainty is unattainable.
The notion of Dionysius that one century of musicians
voted with the seniors, the other with the juniors, and so
of the mechanics,<a id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> is erroneous; for the seniors did not vote
separately from the juniors.</p>

<p>In the centuriate assembly each of the six tribal troops of
knights<a id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> had one vote, and was called, therefore, a suffragium.
As the term centuria had not previously applied to these groups,
it was for a time withheld from them in the comitia, the six
divisions being known simply as the sex suffragia.<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> Afterward
as new voting groups were added to the equites they came to be
called centuries, and thence the term extended to the old.<a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> The
centuriate organization of the comitia did not demand the creation
of suffragia seniorum, to correspond with the centuriae
seniorum of the infantry, perhaps because the six votes in the
comitia centuriata adequately represented the whole number of
patricians. As the equites originally provided their own horses,<a id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a>
they held their rank for life, not merely through the period of
service. After the state had undertaken to furnish money for
the purchase and keeping of the horses,<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> the eques retained
his public horse, and consequently his membership in an equestrian
century, long after his retirement from active duty.<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> The
increase in the number of equestrian votes was owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
participation of plebeians in the mounted service.<a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> From them
twelve equestrian centuries were formed for the centuriate assembly,
and added to the six groups already existing. This increase
probably came about in the course of the fourth century, accompanying
or following the enlargement of the infantry from two to
four legions.<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> Thus the total number of one hundred and ninety-three
centuries could not have been reached till shortly before
269.</p>

<p>The foregoing discussion has made it evident that from the
time when the comitia centuriata came into being, there were
two centuriate organizations; (1) the military, which continued
as before till it changed to the manipular formation,<a id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> (2) the
political, which developed from the military but which was at
no time identical with it.</p>

<p>Before the reform this assembly met in military array with banners
displayed, each company under its centurion.<a id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a> The voting
was oral. Probably it was at first by acclamation; if so the suggestion
of individual voting, as we find it in historical time, must
have come from the orderly military array, which offered itself
conveniently for the purpose.<a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a> The centurions may originally
have served as rogatores, to collect and report the votes.<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a>
Each century cast a single vote, which in historical time the
majority of its members decided.<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> The voting proceeded according
to classes; the equites were asked first, hence their
centuries were termed prerogative (praerogativae), then the
eighty centuries of the first class. If the votes of these two
groups were unanimous, they decided the question at issue; as
ninety-seven was a majority, they had one to spare from their
total number. If they disagreed, the second class was called
and then the third and so on to the proletarian century. But
the voting ceased as soon as a majority was reached, which
was often with the first class; and it rarely happened that the
proletarians were called on to decide the issue.<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a> The announcement
of the prerogative votes greatly influenced the
action of those which followed.<a id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a></p>

<h4>II. <i>The Reform</i></h4>

<p>The study of the centuriate assembly begun earlier in the
volume<a id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> and continued in the preceding part of this chapter
shows it gradually developing its organization during the fifth
and fourth centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The main line of progress has been
traced though details are unknown. The growth of popular
rights in the latter half of the fourth century gave a great impetus
to the activity of the assemblies in general, as is manifested
in the Genucian, Publilian, and Hortensian legislation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
In 312 when the change was made in the appraisements from
land to money, many aerarii who had voted with the proletarians
must have been advanced to the higher classes.<a id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> This
step toward the democratization of the comitia centuriata, following
upon the reduction of the patrum auctoritas to a mere
formality, could not help adding new energy to the institution,
leading to further changes in a popular direction. The class
ratings which are known to history were established no earlier
than 269.<a id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> Two other more important changes, which can be
but approximately dated, must now be considered in detail.
They are (1) the abolition of the equestrian prerogative and the
introduction of the custom of drawing by lot a prerogative century
from the first class on each occasion before the voting began;
(2) the division of the citizens into classes and centuries
within the several tribes. These two innovations are commonly
grouped together under the name of the “reform.” As they
have no necessary connection with one another, they need not
have been simultaneous. Livy’s narrative of the happenings
of 396<a id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> and of 383<a id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> seems to imply that they had been introduced
before these dates.<a id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> But the passages here referred to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
are uncertain; and at all events they belong to a period in
which the centuries may still have been closely connected with
the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> But should they be so interpreted as to apply to
the reformed centuriate assembly, they might still be looked
upon as historical anticipations for the reason that Livy’s<a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> account
of the year 296 has reference to a feature of the old organization.
This disposition of the three passages is supported
by the following consideration. Had the reform been introduced
much earlier than 269, the annalists would have assigned
it to Servius Tullius, just as they assigned to him thirty tribes
(reached in 318), all thirty-five tribes (reached in 241), and the
census ratings in the sextantarian asses (established in or after
269);<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a> and in that case all memory of the original Servian system
would have been lost. The circumstance that we are acquainted
with it in some detail is proof of its survival into the
third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> In fact Livy’s<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> chief reference to the reform
indicates that it was completed, if not undertaken, after the number
of tribes had been brought up to thirty-five (241). On the
other hand it came before the opening of his third decade (218),
which takes the new arrangement for granted.<a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> The contention
is often made that Livy must have given an account of the
reform in his second decade (292-219) now lost; and there is a
universal agreement that the reform was brought about not by
statute, but by arbitrary censorial disposition.<a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a> The censor
commonly assumed to be the author of the change is either
Fabius Buteo, 241, or Flaminius, 220.<a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a> Against the latter may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
be urged the silence of Polybius<a id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a> and Livy,<a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a> who in speaking
at length of his opposition to the nobles makes no reference to
this reform. In favor of Fabius it may be said that in 241 the
full number of tribes was completed; and the name of the
thirty-fifth, Quirina, corresponding to Romilia, the first rural
tribe, suggests that the Romans intended to create no more. In
naming the last tribe the censors seem to have had in mind the
completion of the new system, to each component part of which
they apparently guaranteed a definite share of political power,
which would have been impaired by the further creation of
tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a></p>

<p>A little reflection, however, will convince us of the impossibility
of assigning the reform to any one censor or to a definite
date. Livy could not have made much of it in the lost part of
his history without leaving some trace in the epitome, which
mentions far more trivial matters.<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> The only explanation of
the epitomator’s silence is that the reform was so gradual as to
escape marked attention. This view is supported by a strict
interpretation of Livy,<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> who supposes the change to have come
about naturally with the increase in the number of tribes, and
of Dionysius,<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> who ascribes the innovation, or a part of it, to no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
individual but to “certain powerful forces.” A conclusion as
to the date of the reform, to be acceptable, must satisfy the
conditions above mentioned. In earlier time, when there was
a single classis, the centuries were made up within the tribes;
but this simple system was rendered impossible by the increase
in the number of classes.<a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> For convenience of administration
the censors must soon after this enlargement have begun an
effort to reduce the discord to harmony. One class may have
been brought into agreement with the tribes more readily than
another, and thus the readaptation may have extended through
many lustra. The number of centuries probably did not long
remain at one hundred and ninety-three. It may have received
its first increase above that sum in 304, for instance, the date to
which Niebuhr<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> assigns the reform. The process may have
been far advanced in 241, the date preferred by a majority of
scholars, and completed by Flaminius in 220.<a id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> The abolition
of the equestrian prerogative may likewise have been gradual;
it may have been retained in one class of comitial acts—elections
or legislation, for instance—longer than in another. The
conclusion that the changes were gradually introduced in the
period from 304 to 220 would best explain all the known facts.<a id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a></p>

<p>As no description of the reformed organization has come
down to us, we are obliged to reconstruct it from the scant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
references of various writers. It is to be noted first that the
five classes continued in the new system.<a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a> They were still
based on the census,<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a> and were called to vote in their order as
before.<a id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> The distinction between juniors and seniors was retained;<a id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a>
and as these comitia were still called centuriata, the
centuries necessarily continued as the voting units.<a id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> But the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
reform brought them into direct relation with the tribes, which
now served as a basis for the division into centuries and for
their distribution according to age and class. On this point
Livy<a id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> remarks, “We ought not to wonder that the arrangement
which now exists after the tribes have been increased to thirty-five,
their number being doubled in the centuries of juniors and
seniors, does not agree with the total number instituted by
Servius Tullius; for he divided the city into four parts, ...
which he called tribes.... Nor did those tribes have any
relation to the distribution and number of the centuries.” From
this passage we may infer (1) that in the reformed assembly
the number and distribution of the centuries depended closely
upon the tribes—a conclusion supported by other citations to
be given hereafter, (2) that the number of centuries was
changed, although we are not distinctly informed whether by
diminution or increase. According to one interpretation the
number of tribes was doubled by the number of centuries of
juniors and seniors, and there were therefore seventy of these
centuries, thirty-five juniors and as many seniors, each century
forming a half tribe. This view is supported by passages in
which the century bears the name of the tribe, as Aniensis
iuniorum,<a id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> Voturia iuniorum,<a id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a> Galeria iuniorum,<a id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> as well as by
those which in a more general way refer to voting or the announcement
of the votes by or according to tribes in the centuriate
assembly.<a id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a> It accords perfectly with other evidence that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
the century was an integral part of the tribe.<a id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> This is the
view adopted by Niebuhr.<a id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> It is open, however, to the fatal
objection of abolishing the classes, which in fact continued
through the republic, as has already been shown.<a id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a> He does
indeed allow for a first class comprising the country tribes and
a second class made up of the others;<a id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> but this hypothesis is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
overthrown by those citations which imply the continuance of
all five classes,<a id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a> as well as by those which make the census an
element of the later organization.<a id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a> Huschke,<a id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> who places the
reform in the earliest times of the republic, adopts Niebuhr’s
view as to the number of centuries; but maintaining the continuance
of the five classes,<a id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> he considers them to be groups of
tribes, the seventeen old rural tribes being distributed as follows:
in the first class eight, in the second, third, and fourth
respectively two, in the fifth three.<a id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> But bearing in mind that
these tribes were primarily local, we cannot at the same time
regard them as census groups without ascribing to them an
impossibly artificial character. For this reason the theory of
Huschke should be rejected. To avoid this difficulty, while retaining
the classes, the assumption has been made that the
classes were subdivisions of the century, in other words that
each century contained men of every class. This view is invalidated
by the fact that the centuries continued to be divisions
of the classes, which were still called to vote in their
order.<a id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a></p>

<p>The assumption of a diminution in number having proved
untenable, the conclusion is that there was an increase.<a id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a> In
view of the facts (1) that the reformed organization rested on a
tribal basis,<a id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a> (2) that the centuries were divisions not only of the
tribes<a id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> but also of the classes,<a id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> (3) that the tribes could not have
been divisions of the classes,<a id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a> it is necessary to conclude that the
classes were themselves divisions of the tribes with the centuries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
as subdivisions. In other words, the work of organization took
place within the tribe: the members of a tribe were first divided
into five classes according to their wealth; within each class the
men were grouped on the basis of age into juniors and seniors,<a id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a>
one century for each within the several classes, making ten
centuries of juniors to the tribe, or in all three hundred and
fifty tribal centuries, to which are to be added eighteen centuries
of knights and probably five supernumerary centuries, amounting
to a total of three hundred and seventy-three. This is
substantially the view of Pantagathus.<a id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> Convincing evidence
is afforded by a group of inscriptions of the imperial period.<a id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a>
From them we learn that under the emperors the urban tribes
comprised severally (1) a corpus seniorum, (2) a corpus iuniorum,
(3) the tribus Sucusana a corpus Iulianum, and the Palatine
and Esquiline each a corpus Augustale. Every corpus consisted
of several centuries. In the corpus Sucusana iuniorum
were eight centuries divided into two groups of five and three
respectively, the first group being evidently superior to the
second. At the head of the century was a centurio or curator.<a id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a>
Eliminating the corpora which were named after emperors and
which must have been instituted in their time, eliminating also
the inferior centuries of the corpora seniorum and iuniorum,
which were undoubtedly added either by the emperors or by the
late republican censors, we have remaining five centuries to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
corpus as it must have stood in the period immediately following
the reform. This result confirms the view suggested by
Pantagathus.</p>

<p>It was accepted by Mommsen in his <i>Römische Tribus</i> (1844)
and in the first seven editions of his <i>History of Rome</i>; but in
his <i>Römisches Staatsrecht</i><a id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a> he has offered a radical modification:
while holding to the 373 centuries, he maintains that they were
so combined as to cast in all 193 votes. According to this
theory the first class comprised 35 × 2 = 70 centuries, each with
one vote, whereas the remaining classes together, made up of
4 × 35 × 2 = 280 centuries, cast but 100 votes. How the centuries
were combined Mommsen does not presume to say. He
considers it possible, however, that for instance sixty of the
seventy centuries of the second class were grouped by threes
and ten by twos, making twenty-five voting groups in all. Had
he attempted to follow out in detail the practical working of the
theory, he would hardly have offered it to the public. The
votes could not have been determined by a majority of component
centuries, for according to the theory some groups comprised
but two. Or if the group voted by individuals without
regard to the component centuries, the four lower classes were
practically composed not of centuries but of larger, nameless
voting divisions.</p>

<p>His main support is the account of the centuriate organization
given in Cicero’s <i>Republic</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> which speaks of a hundred and
ninety-three centuries, and which Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a> believes to be a
description of the reformed organization. Cicero’s<a id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> assumption
that the essential facts were known to the friends of the younger
Scipio—the leader in the dialogue—and the discrepancy in
the number of centuries of the first class between the Servian
system as given by the annalists (Livy and Dionysius) and the
organization which Cicero describes<a id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> are the chief points in
Mommsen’s favor. Against his interpretation it may be urged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
(1) that the passage is exceedingly uncertain;<a id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> (2) that Cicero
makes Servius Tullius the author of the organization which he
describes; (3) that though the reform affected the details of the
comitial organization, the principle—a distribution of the people
according to ordines, census, aetates—remained the same from
the time of Servius to the time of Cicero, so that he could
assume that it was known to the hearers of Scipio; (4) that as
to the discrepancy in the number of centuries in the first class,
on the assumption that the text is correct, (<i>a</i>) Cicero, who was
by no means infallible, may have made a mistake,<a id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> being in this
case especially liable to error because in the reformed organization
the first class comprised seventy centuries, or (<i>b</i>) in case
Cicero is right, either (<i>m</i>) the annalists may be in error in
assigning eighty centuries to the first class, or (<i>n</i>) in an early
stage of transition from the old to the new organization the
number of centuries in the first class may have been cut down
to seventy with a corresponding increase of ten in some other
part of the system; (5) that Mommsen’s theory is refuted by the
language of Cicero,<a id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> who speaks of the voting divisions of the
four lower classes not as groups of centuries but simply as
centuries, the absence of a name for such a group being one
of the strongest arguments against its existence. Mommsen’s
interpretation of the passage is in brief too strained and unnatural
to commend itself to the understanding. Apart from its
lack of support in the sources, an objection to the theory is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
its extreme impracticability. Holding that juniors and seniors
could not have been brought together in the same voting divisions,
and assuming that the combinations were made by twos
and threes and that the four lower classes had an equal number
of votes, Klebs has worked out the simplest arrangement as
follows:</p>

<p>This complex system would make the action of the centuriate
assembly exceedingly slow and difficult, and would be as useless
as impracticable; for if the object was to reduce the votes of
the first class by ten and to make the other classes equal, that
end could have been easily attained by the readjustment of numbers
on the old basis, without the invention of this awkward
grouping, the like of which is not known to have existed in any
ancient or modern state. Such a reform, too, would bring out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
more clearly than ever the inequality of rights in the comitia,<a id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a>
and therefore could not have been called democratic by Dionysius.<a id="FNanchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a>
It is contradicted also by Livy,<a id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> who distinctly states
that the number of centuries was changed. Lastly the objection
must be made that the joining of centuries of different tribes
into voting units cannot be reconciled with the imperial grouping
of centuries of the same tribe into corpora,<a id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> and is refuted by
the many citations which assume the voting or the announcement
of the votes to have proceeded according to tribes<a id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> as well
as according to classes.<a id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a></p>

<p>Lange,<a id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a> not thinking it necessary to preserve a total of a
hundred and ninety-three votes but accepting in the main the
view of Pantagathus, tries to bring the centuries into relation
with the tribes by assuming that the seventy half-tribes, severally
comprising five centuries of juniors or seniors, were
given each one vote in the “concluding announcement”
(Schlussrenuntiation), this vote being determined by a majority
of the five component centuries. In like manner the eighteen
centuries of knights were grouped in divisions of three centuries
each, so as to count six votes in the final announcement, hence
the name sex suffragia. The supernumerary centuries were
grouped in one or two voting divisions, so that in all seventy-seven
or seventy-eight votes were cast.<a id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a> As to the process,
he believed that after the prerogative the seventy centuries
of the first class and the eighteen centuries of cavalry voted
simultaneously, and while their votes were being counted the
second class was voting, the votes, in his opinion, not being
announced as soon as known.<a id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a> This view as to the announcement
is contradicted by the sources,<a id="FNanchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a> which clearly imply that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
the reports were made public as they came in. Against his
theory may be urged also (1) the fact that no name existed for
the half-tribe, which in his opinion cast one vote in the closing
announcement,<a id="FNanchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a> as well as (2) the fact that the sources give
more than six votes to the equites in the late republic.<a id="FNanchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a> Lange
is right, however, in understanding that the voting did not
now, as formerly, cease when a majority was reached, but
continued till all the centuries had voted.<a id="FNanchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a></p>

<p>A solution of the problem as to the order of voting suggested
by Klebs<a id="FNanchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a> seems to satisfy all conditions. The centuries gave
their votes by classes, each being announced as soon as it
was ascertained. Then when all the centuries had voted, a
count was taken by tribes in the order determined by lot;<a id="FNanchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> and
a second announcement, made in that order, decided the election
or other act of the people. Each candidate was declared
elected when a majority of votes was reached in his favor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>Regarding the supernumerary centuries our information is
extremely meagre. As it does not seem likely that influential
corporations would be robbed of a privilege they once enjoyed,
we may reasonably believe that the artisans, musicians, and
accensi velati retained centuries of their own in the reformed
organization. Cicero,<a id="FNanchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a> however, speaks of a single century
of artisans for his time. The two industrial colleges, which
had existed from an early age,<a id="FNanchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> seem to have been joined
in one and to have continued into the imperial period after
nearly all the other guilds had been abolished.<a id="FNanchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a> When the
two were united, they were probably reduced to a single vote
in the assembly. In like manner the liticines, or tubicines,
and the cornicines were united in one college of musicians<a id="FNanchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a> and
were probably given one vote. The accensi velati, too, formed
a college composed of wealthy freedmen, freeborn, and even
knights.<a id="FNanchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a> We may well suppose that it still possessed a vote
in the centuriate assembly. Lastly may be mentioned the
century of proletarians and that of the tardy,<a id="FNanchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a> which were as
necessary after the reform as before it.<a id="FNanchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a> Although new centuries
were added, possibly by the later republican censors
and certainly by the emperors,<a id="FNanchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a> the principle of the reformed
organization remained unchanged.<a id="FNanchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a></p>

<p>In the reformed assembly the equestrian centuries ceased to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
be prerogative.<a id="FNanchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a> A century was drawn from the first class<a id="FNanchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a> by
lot<a id="FNanchor_1346" href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a> to take the lead in voting. Then came the remainder of the
class, including the equestrian centuries and the single century of
artisans, eighty-eight in all. In the announcement the votes of
the equites were distinguished from those of the class;<a id="FNanchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a> and
the sex suffragia, no longer exclusively patrician,<a id="FNanchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a> were reported
after the other eighty-two. The inferior place assigned to the
suffragia was evidently to remove them far from their earlier
prerogative position so as to free the assembly from patrician
influence. Next the lower classes, among which other supernumerary
centuries were distributed as in the earlier republic,
voted in order; and finally came the summing up by tribes in
the way described above. The old military array gave place to
a civilian grouping like that already established for the curiate
and tribal assemblies.<a id="FNanchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FUNCTIONS OF THE COMITIA CENTURIATA</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I. <i>Elective</i></h4>

<p>The first act of the centuriate assembly according to Livy,<a id="FNanchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a>
who has certainly placed the beginning of its functions at the
earliest possible date,<a id="FNanchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a> was the election of the first two consuls.
Thereafter these comitia not only continued to elect the consuls,
but also naturally acquired the right to choose all elective higher
magistrates, extraordinary as well as ordinary, who were
entrusted temporarily or permanently with some or all of the
consular power—including the decemviri legibus scribundis,
451, 450, the tribuni militum consulari potestate, beginning in
444, the two censors, beginning in 443 (or 435?), and the praetors,
increased gradually from one in 366 to sixteen under
Caesar.<a id="FNanchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a> The activity of this assembly in elections expanded
with the growth in the number of offices; and its importance
was further enhanced by the opening of the patrician magistracies
to plebeians. The validity of a centuriate elective act
depended upon the subsequent curiate law, which soon became
a mere form, and upon the patrum auctoritas. The latter, too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
was deprived of all vitality by the Maenian plebiscite,<a id="FNanchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a> which
required the act to be passed before the election while the issue
was uncertain.<a id="FNanchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a> The date of this plebiscite is unknown; but it
probably followed close upon the Hortensian legislation (287).<a id="FNanchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a></p>

<h4>II. <i>Legislative</i></h4>

<p>In an earlier chapter<a id="FNanchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> it was shown that primitive Rome, like
primitive Greece, regarded law as god-given—a conception
which left no scope for legislation by a popular assembly.
Though under the kings the people may occasionally have been
called to vote on a resolution affecting their customs, the comitia
curiata never acquired a law-making function.<a id="FNanchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> Even the declaration
of war, which historical Rome looked upon as a lex, was
issued by the king without the consent of the community, his
only need being to secure the hearty support of the warriors.<a id="FNanchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a>
It seems probable therefore that this question came, not before
the comitia, but before a military contio.<a id="FNanchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a> From the custom of
the soldiers to participate in the settlement of questions touching
their interests<a id="FNanchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a> developed the function of declaring war.
The people, however, were slow in acquiring the right. It is
true that several such acts are mentioned by Dionysius for the
early republic—for the war against the Volscians, 489,<a id="FNanchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a> against
Veii, 482,<a id="FNanchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a> and against the Aequians and Volscians in 462.<a id="FNanchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a>
These instances may be explained either as acclamations in
contio or as exceptional votes in the comitia centuriata, or with
more probability, owing to the character of our sources for those
early times, as anticipations of later usage. The decisive fact
in the problem is that as late as 427 a controversy arose as to
whether war could be declared by order of the people only, or
whether a senatus consultum was sufficient. It was settled in
favor of the people by the threats of the plebeian tribunes to
impede the levy.<a id="FNanchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a> For the next hundred years mention is often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
made of the exercise of this function by the people;<a id="FNanchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a> and when
a declaration was once issued by them, it could be recalled only
by their vote.<a id="FNanchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a> During the period of the Samnite wars the
assembly still more frequently made use of this right.<a id="FNanchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a> In
better known times we find it firmly established. The people
declared war against Carthage in 264,<a id="FNanchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a> against the Illyrians in
229,<a id="FNanchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a> against Carthage again in 218,<a id="FNanchor_1370" href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a> against Macedon in 200,<a id="FNanchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a>
against Antiochus in 191,<a id="FNanchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a> against Macedon again in 171,<a id="FNanchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a>
against Jugurtha in 111.<a id="FNanchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a> In the case of the two Macedonian
wars here referred to, the declaration is mentioned as an act of
the comitia centuriata.<a id="FNanchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a> In 167 the praetor M. Juventus Thalna
attempted to pass through the tribal assembly a lex de bello
indicendo against the Rhodians, but was effectually opposed by
a tribune of the plebs;<a id="FNanchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a> so that the function continued to be
exclusively centuriate. Cn. Manlius Volso in 189 made war
upon the Gallograeci without an order of the people or a decree
of the senate, and was on that ground accused in the senate by
two of his legati.<a id="FNanchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a> We conclude, however, that the charge was
fruitless from the circumstance that the senate finally decreed
him a triumph.<a id="FNanchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a> For beginning war against the Histrians on
his own responsibility the consul A. Manlius, 178, was threatened
with a prosecution, which was quashed by a tribunician
veto.<a id="FNanchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> Licinius Lucullus was not even brought to trial for the
war he waged without an order of the people against the Vaccaei
in 151.<a id="FNanchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a> Hence it appears that though a magistrate could
not legally begin war on his own initiative, there was no real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
danger of condemnation for so doing. The reason is that those
in authority attached little importance to the right of the comitia
in the matter. Only once is mentioned a fear lest the people
may not give their consent to a war.<a id="FNanchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a> One case of rejection
is recorded, and even here the centuries at a second session
obediently accepted the consul’s proposition.<a id="FNanchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> The control of
diplomacy and of the revenues by the senate and magistrates
assured these powers the practical decision of questions of war
and peace to such an extent that ratification by the assembly
could ordinarily be counted on as certain; and its influence
decreased with the expansion of the empire. Meantime, however,
the idea of popular sovereignty, which was expressing
itself in other spheres of government, effectually demanded, if
only in form, some concession to the assembly in this field as
well; and accordingly in the formula of declaration “populus”
wholly takes the place of the once all-important “senatus.”<a id="FNanchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a>
By such empty concessions the nobility rendered the people
more docile. Thus to the end of the republic the centuriate
assembly retained the constitutional right to decide questions of
aggressive war, although in practice the magistrates nearly
regained the place which they and the senate had held during
the century following the overthrow of kingship.<a id="FNanchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a></p>

<p>The nature of our sources does not allow a precise judgment
regarding the importance of the comitia curiata in the early
republic. To the time of the Gallic invasion it may occasionally
have passed resolutions affecting the status of citizens.<a id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a>
But as legislation never became an acknowledged function of
the curiae, we are in a position to assert that through the comitia
centuriata the people were first introduced into this sphere
of public life.<a id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a></p>

<p>The earliest legislation of this assembly, in fact the earliest
recorded legislative act of the Roman people, was the lex de
provocatione attributed to Valerius Publicola, consul in the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
year of the republic, 509.<a id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a> It was also through the centuriate
assembly that the consuls Valerius and Horatius in 449 passed a
law which forbade the election of a magistrate without appeal, and
affixed as a penalty the outlawing of the trespasser.<a id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a> The third
Valerian law of appeal in 300<a id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a> was an act of the same assembly,
whereas all three Porcian laws on the same subject seem to
have been tribal.<a id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a> The legislative function of the centuriate
assembly, resting in the pre-decemviral period simply on precedent,
brought into being the statute of 471 to establish a tribal
assembly for the transaction of plebeian business, improperly
known as the Publilian law,<a id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a> the lex sacrata for the division of
the Aventine among the plebeians, erroneously termed Icilian,
456,<a id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> the lex Aternia Tarpeia de multae dictione, 454,<a id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a> the lex
Menenia Sextia on the same subjects in 452,<a id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a> the laws ratifying
the Twelve Tables in 451, 449<a id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a>—all excepting the second having
reference to the limitation of the magisterial power. Regarding
the creation of offices, no mention is made of a law for the
institution of the consulate itself; but the centuries passed a
law for the creation of the dictatorship, 501,<a id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a> and of the decemviri
legibus scribundis, which should be named Sestian after
the consul who undoubtedly proposed it, 452.<a id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a> Thus far popular
legislation had no basis excepting precedent, but a law of
the Twelve Tables now provided that there should be resolutions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
and votes of the people, and whatever the people voted
last should be law and valid—the first clear enunciation of the
principle that the will of the people, whenever expressed, prevailed
over every other authority.<a id="FNanchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> It was far from establishing
popular sovereignty, however, for the initiative remained with
the magistrates.</p>

<p>The activity of the comitia centuriata, thus authoritatively
established, manifested itself in the passing of the Valerian-Horatian
laws of 449,<a id="FNanchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a> the lex Iulia Papiria de multarum aestimatione,
430,<a id="FNanchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> the law for the election of six military tribunes by
the comitia tributa, 362,<a id="FNanchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a> the law of the dictator Publilius Philo,
339,<a id="FNanchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a> the third Valerian law concerning appeal, 300,<a id="FNanchor_1403" href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a> and finally
the Hortensian law, 287.<a id="FNanchor_1404" href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a> All have reference to the regulation of
magistracies or of assemblies. Meantime the centuriate comitia
passed the law for instituting tribunes of the soldiers with consular
power, 445,<a id="FNanchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a> and censors, 443<a id="FNanchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a> (or 435?), for increasing
the number of quaestors, 421,<a id="FNanchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a> for instituting the praetorship,
367,<a id="FNanchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a> and the curule aedileship in the same year.<a id="FNanchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a> All the
laws thus far mentioned, excepting that for the division of the
Aventine, effected important modifications of the constitution,
the most of them forced upon the senate and magistrates in the
struggle for equal rights in which the commons were engaged
with the nobility. In like manner two provisions of the Valerian
law of 342, (1) that the name of no soldier should be erased<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
from the muster roll without his consent. (2) that no military
tribune should be degraded to the rank of centurion,<a id="FNanchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a> established
under the sanction of an oath certain fundamental rights on
which the soldiers and their officers respectively insisted.
Another provision, the total abolition of debts,<a id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a> if indeed it is
historical, was administrative, and is considered therefore in
another connection.<a id="FNanchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a> Of the same nature, though less sweeping,
was the Hortensian provision for the relief of debtors.</p>

<p>As soon as there came to be plebeian senators (about 400),
the patricians reserved to themselves the right to decide on
the legality of legislative and elective acts of the people under
patrician presidency—a right designated by the phrase patrum
auctoritas, which signified originally the authorization of the
senators, thereafter of the patrician senators. Till 339 the
patres were at liberty to give or withhold the auctoritas; but in
that year an article of the Publilian law required them to grant
it to legislative acts of the centuries before the voting began
and while the issue was still in doubt, reducing it in this way
to a mere formality.<a id="FNanchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> The effect was to free centuriate legislation
from the constitutional control hitherto exercised by patrician
senators.<a id="FNanchor_1414" href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a> Henceforth the resolutions of this assembly
could be declared illegal by no less than a majority of the entire
senate. The Publilian statute, accordingly, deprived the patricians
of an important power, whereas the senate as a whole
continued through its consulta to exercise an increasing influence
over the comitia centuriata. Polybius rightly ascribes to
the consuls, therefore, the function of bringing the resolutions
of the senate before the assembly. It could not have been the
intention of Publilius Philo to energize the comitia centuriata<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
by this provision; for another article of the same statute, confirming
the validity of the tribunician assembly of tribes, as
then actually constituted exclusively of plebeians, paved the
way for the Hortensian law, which by making the acts of the
tribunician assembly in every respect equal to those of the centuries,
deprived the latter of their great importance as a factor
in constitutional progress. From the time of Hortensius to the
time of Sulla no constitutional statute is known to have been
enacted by the centuriate assembly; though our sources do not
give us clear information on the point, it is highly probable
that the consuls and dictators of this period preferred to bring
their measures however important before the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a> In Sulla’s
time the lex Valeria, 82,<a id="FNanchor_1416" href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a> clothing him with his extraordinary
dictatorship rei publicae constituendae, must have been passed
by the centuries, which alone in addition to the politically
obsolete comitia curiata could be summoned by an interrex, as
was the author of the law. This act, Lange remarks, cannot
well be considered a revival of the legislative power of the centuries,
as it was not only passed through intimidation and under
a magistrate who had no constitutional right to initiate legislation,
but it also created a legalized tyranny destructive of popular
freedom.<a id="FNanchor_1417" href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a> In the words of Cicero it was the most iniquitous
of all laws and most unlike a law.<a id="FNanchor_1418" href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a> Only one of Sulla’s statutes,
the lex de civitate Volaterranis adimenda, 81, which, depriving
the Volaterrani of their civitas cum suffragio, placed them
in the condition of the Latins of Ariminum, is known to have
been an act of the centuries.<a id="FNanchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a> Probably all his other laws were
ratified by the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a> C. Julius Caesar preferably used the
tribes, although it is possible that his lex de provinciis and his
lex iudiciaria came before the comitia centuriata.<a id="FNanchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a></p>

<p>Sulla’s constitutional legislation curtailed the powers of the
plebeian tribunes and of their assembly, proportionally increasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
the importance of the centuries; and although his form of
government was of short duration, the optimates thereafter
naturally preferred the comitia centuriata for the ratification
of senatorial resolutions.<a id="FNanchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a> To this assembly accordingly belong
the leges Vibiae of the consul C. Vibius Pansa, 43, which confirmed
the acts of Caesar, and took the place of Antony’s leges
de coloniis deducendis and of his lex de dictatura tollenda.<a id="FNanchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a></p>

<p>On the institution of the censorship, and by the law which
called the office into being, it was enacted that elections of censors
should be ratified, not by the curiae as in the case of other
magistrates, but by the centuries themselves.<a id="FNanchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a> Before this date
the principle was already established that the people should
vote twice in the election of every magistrate in order that if
they repented of their choice, they might recall it by a second
vote.<a id="FNanchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a> As the primary function of the censors was the periodical
reconstitution of the comitia centuriata, it was doubtless
thought appropriate that this assembly alone should be concerned
with the election. The lex centuriata de potestate censoria,
evidently passed under consular presidency, remained,
like the curiate law in confirmation of elections to other offices,
a mere form. It was of too little practical significance ever to
be noticed by the historians; in fact no individual instance of
the passing of this act is mentioned by any extant writer.
Characteristically the lex Aemilia, 433, which is alleged to have
cut down the term of censorship to eighteen months,<a id="FNanchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a> and the
lex Publilia Philonis, 339, which provided that at least one censor
must be a plebeian,<a id="FNanchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a> were centuriate, whereas the Licinian-Sextian
law, 367, which provided that one consul must be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
plebeian,<a id="FNanchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a> and the Genucian law, 342, permitting both to be,<a id="FNanchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a>
were plebiscites.</p>

<p>An occasional attempt was made by a magistrate to usurp for
the comitia centuriata a share in the administration. The first
which is worthy of notice,<a id="FNanchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a> even though it may be mythical, is
the agrarian proposal of Sp. Cassius, 486. According to the
sources it was opposed by the senate and the colleague of the
mover. Far from enacting it into a law, the author, on the expiration
of his consulship, was himself accused of attempting to
usurp the royal power, and was, in one version of the story,
condemned to death by the assembly to which he had offered
the bill.<a id="FNanchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a> The senate must have taken very seriously this first
attempt of a magistrate to transfer some of its administrative
power to the comitia. The law for the division of the Aventine
Hill among the people, 456, was actually passed, most probably
by the centuries.<a id="FNanchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a> It was forced upon the government by the
plebeians, and did not serve as a precedent for the future. The
Valerian law of 342,<a id="FNanchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a> which abolished debts, was an extraordinary
administrative measure similar in character, but far more
sweeping, to the clause for the relief of debtors in the Licinian-Sextian
plebiscite.</p>

<p>If then the centuriate assembly was excluded from the field
of administration, it must certainly in pre-decemviral times have
had no part in religious legislation. The law which regulated
the intercalary month inscribed on a bronze column by Pinarius
and Furius, consuls in 472,<a id="FNanchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a> and the ancient law composed in
archaic letters, mentioned in connection with the year 363,<a id="FNanchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a> requiring
the praetor maximus to drive the nail on the ides of
September, must accordingly have been acts, not of the centuriate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
assembly, but of the pontifical college. By the ratification
of the Twelve Tables, composed chiefly of private laws and of
closely connected religious regulations, an example was set for
the invasion of both of these legal spheres by the centuriate
assembly. But the precedent remained unproductive; for at
this time the tribal assembly under plebeian or patrician magistrates
was recognized as competent for legislation, and naturally
took to itself the function of enacting the less weighty,
for a time generally the non-constitutional, laws.<a id="FNanchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a> We are not
to imagine the field of legislation clearly divided into constitutional,
private, religious, and other departments; aside from the
question of declaring an offensive war, which remained strictly
the province of the comitia centuriata, the distinction in legislation
was simply between the more and the less important;
the dignified assembly of centuries, organized on an aristocratic-timocratic
basis, was entrusted with the weightier business,
whereas the simpler tribal assembly, which was easier to summon
and more expeditious in action, served well enough for the
despatch of lighter business. The question of the assembly to
be employed was largely one of inertia; it required a far greater
force of circumstances to set in motion for legislative purposes
the cumbrous centuriate assembly than the relatively mobile
gathering of the tribes.</p>

<h4>III. <i>Judicial</i></h4>

<p>The jurisdiction of the people in whatever assembly was confined
to cases of crime and of serious disobedience to magistrates.<a id="FNanchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a>
It was not exercised by them in the first instance but
only by way of appeal. In the opinion of the Romans Tullus
Hostilius was the first to grant an appeal,<a id="FNanchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a> necessarily to the comitia
curiata, which under the kings remained the only formally
voting assembly.<a id="FNanchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a> During the regal period, the well attested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
appellate function of the comitia<a id="FNanchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a> was simply precarious, depending
wholly on the pleasure of the king.<a id="FNanchor_1441" href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a> The Romans
represented the advance in liberty brought by the republic as
consisting partly in the establishment of the right of appeal for
every citizen through the lex de provocatione of Valerius,<a id="FNanchor_1442" href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a> a
consul of the first year of the republic—according to Cicero
the first law carried through the comitia centuriata—providing
that no magistrate should scourge or put to death a citizen
without granting him an appeal to the people.<a id="FNanchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a> Although the
historical existence of this Valerius has been questioned, and
though his law has the appearance of being an anticipation of the
Valerian law of 449, or more closely of that of 300,<a id="FNanchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a> we must
admit in favor of its reality that the decemvirs were themselves
exceptionally above appeal and that their laws guaranteed to the
citizens an extensive use of the right.<a id="FNanchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a> The appellant, however,
had no legal means of enforcing his right against the magistrate;
he could do no more than “throw himself on the mercy
of the crowd, and trust that their shouts or murmurs would
bend the magistrate to respect the law.”<a id="FNanchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a> The first lex Valeria,
accordingly, brought little real benefit to the citizens.<a id="FNanchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
right was recognized and its application extended, as intimated
above, by the Twelve Tables, in which various laws relating not
only to capital crimes but to some of less importance granted
an appeal to the people.<a id="FNanchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a> It was provided also by a special
statute of the code that judgments as well as laws involving life
or citizenship could be passed only by the comitiatus maximus,
which is evidently the comitia centuriata.<a id="FNanchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a></p>

<p>The Valerian-Horatian law of appeal, 449, was directed
against the recurrence of the decemvirate or any similar magistracy
with absolute jurisdiction, and hence resembled neither
the laws of the Twelve Tables referring to the subject nor the
Valerian law of 509. It provided that any one who brought
about the election of such a magistracy might be put to death
with impunity,<a id="FNanchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a> and is alleged to have been reinforced by a Duillian
plebiscite of the same year, which set the penalty of scourging
and death for the same offence.<a id="FNanchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a> These regulations could
not refer to the dictatorship, which was appointive not elective,
and which continued to possess absolute jurisdiction for more
than a century after the decemviral legislation.<a id="FNanchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a></p>

<p>But legal rights by no means imply actual enjoyment; and
the decemviral laws of appeal must have long remained substantially
inoperative through lack of a power sufficiently interested
in their enforcement; “the might of the few was stronger
than the liberty of the commons.”<a id="FNanchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a> The right was limited, too,
by the first milestone,<a id="FNanchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a> and hence did not affect the imperium
militiae.<a id="FNanchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a> The only punishment of a magistrate for refusal to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
grant an appeal even by the Valerian law of 300, was to be deemed
wicked.<a id="FNanchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a> Furthermore the oft-recurring dictatorship was unrestricted
by the law, being in this respect a temporary restoration
of the regal office.<a id="FNanchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a> Not till after the enactment of the
last Valerian statute did the people begin to enjoy in fact the
privilege which had long been constitutionally theirs. The
enforcement of the law, as in general of the rights of the
citizens, was chiefly due to the plebeian tribunate, “the only
sure protection even of oppressed patricians,”<a id="FNanchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a> but itself a limitation
on the jurisdiction of the assembly.<a id="FNanchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a> At some unknown
date after 325<a id="FNanchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a> the dictator’s authority within the city was subjected
to appeal; and it has accordingly been suggested that
this limitation was due to the Valerian law of 300.<a id="FNanchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a></p>

<p>The practical establishment of the right of appeal ordinarily
led the magistrate in the exercise of his disciplinary power
to substitute light fines and imprisonment, which he had full
power to enforce, for the heavier penalty of scourging.<a id="FNanchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a> But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
in case of crimes, especially perduellio and parricidium, public
sentiment compelled him to prosecute the accused to the full
extent of the law. In the former accusation the consul of the
early republic appointed duumviri perduellioni iudicandae for each
case as it arose.<a id="FNanchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a> This office is obscure because, without being
formally abolished, it fell early into disuse, its function passing
to the tribunate of the plebs. Of the three cases attributed by
the sources to these duumviri, that of Horatius<a id="FNanchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a> belongs to the
regal period, and is a mythical prototype of the republican
procedure. The offence has the appearance of parricidium.
Only by the broadest interpretation could perduellio be
made to cover the murder of a sister.<a id="FNanchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a> The second case is
that of M. Manlius, 384, according to the more credible account,<a id="FNanchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a>
whereas Livy<a id="FNanchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a> himself is of the opinion that the prosecutors
were the plebeian tribunes. We may conclude, then,
that the duumviri were still employed at this date.<a id="FNanchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a> The third
case is an unsuccessful attempt in 63 to revive the office for the
trial of C. Rabirius.<a id="FNanchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a> The first republican law of appeal must
have empowered the comitia to order the appointment of these
officials by the magistrate;<a id="FNanchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> and it seems probable that at a
later date unknown to us they began to be elected by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
people.<a id="FNanchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a> The function of the duumviri was to try the case and
pronounce sentence, from which if condemnatory the accused
had a right to appeal to the comitia centuriata.<a id="FNanchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a> From the
analogy offered by the questorian procedure we may infer that
the duumviri requested from a higher magistrate permission to
take auspices for that assembly, over which they presided in
the final trial.<a id="FNanchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a></p>

<p>All capital crimes committed by a citizen against another
were in a similar way referred by the consuls to the quaestores
parricidii as their deputies.<a id="FNanchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a> The activity of these officials is
first mentioned by the annalists in connection with the trial of
Sp. Cassius, not for murder but for perduellio.<a id="FNanchor_1475" href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a> Lange’s<a id="FNanchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a> explanation
that the quaestors were appointed duumviri for the
trial would satisfy all requirements; yet in myths of this kind
we need not expect absolute legal consistency.<a id="FNanchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a> According to
another, perhaps even earlier, version he was tried and condemned
at home by his father.<a id="FNanchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a> The second instance is the
trial of M. Volscius, 459, for false testimony,<a id="FNanchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a> which was likewise
a capital crime. Their judicial competence was recognized
by the Twelve Tables;<a id="FNanchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a> and two capital cases are assigned to
their jurisdiction after the decemvirate, (1) that of Camillus on
an accusation variously stated by the ancient authorities;<a id="FNanchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a> he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
avoided capital prosecution before the centuries by retiring into
exile, and in his absence was condemned by the tribes to a fine
of 15,000 or perhaps 100,000 asses: (2) that of T. Quinctius
Trogus brought by the quaestor M. Sergius,<a id="FNanchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a> which must have
taken place after 242.<a id="FNanchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a> The reason for the fewness of the
known cases is to be sought in the circumstance that their
jurisdiction was substantially limited to common crimes, whereas
political crimes came at first before the duumviri and afterward
before the tribunes of the plebs.<a id="FNanchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a> The criminal jurisdiction of
the quaestors must have continued till the institution of standing
quaestiones.<a id="FNanchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a></p>

<p>While the importance of the comitia centuriata as a criminal
court was enhanced by the lex Valeria Horatia and the Duillian
plebiscite of 449, which prohibited the election of a magistrate
with absolute jurisdiction, the number of officials competent to
bring capital actions before this assembly was increased as a
result of that law of the Twelve Tables which enacted that all
resolutions concerning the caput of a Roman citizen should be
offered to the centuries only.<a id="FNanchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a> Thereafter the tribunes were
required to prefer their capital accusations before this assembly,
for the summoning of which they, like the quaestors and the
duumviri perduellioni iudicandae, requested the auspices of a
higher magistrate, ordinarily after 367 of a praetor.<a id="FNanchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a> For a
time, probably till the Hortensian legislation, they were dependent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
upon the patrician magistrates for this privilege.<a id="FNanchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a>
According to our sources the tribunes, with the approval of
the consuls,<a id="FNanchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a> entered upon their new sphere of judicial activity
by bringing a capital charge against Appius Claudius and Sp.
Oppius, past decemvirs, for misconduct in office, the specific
charge being the abuse of justice in the interest of a person or
of a party.<a id="FNanchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a> The suicide of the accused prevented the trial.
On the eight remaining decemvirs they passed in the same
assembly a sentence of exile.<a id="FNanchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a> M. Claudius, too, condemned
for false testimony, was exiled, the death penalty being mitigated
also in his case.<a id="FNanchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a> The tribunes of 439 are said to have
accused L. Minucius and C. Servilius Ahala for the part they
had taken in the death of Sp. Maelius, and two years afterward
Servilius was sentenced to exile by the comitia centuriata, to
be recalled later by the same body. The charge against the
former was false testimony, against the latter the putting to
death of a citizen who had not been legally sentenced.<a id="FNanchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a> Livy
next mentions a charge, probably of perduellio, brought by the
tribunes against Q. Fabius, 390, for having, in violation of the
ius gentium, fought against the Gauls while he was an ambassador
to them. He, too, is said to have died before the
trial.<a id="FNanchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a> All these cases are uncertain. If historical, they may
represent the beginnings of capital jurisdiction of the tribunes,
in rivalry with the duumviri; or they may in reality, like the
case of M. Manlius, 384, already mentioned, have been duumviral.
On either alternative they came before the centuriate
comitia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>As we approach firmer historical ground, we hear of three
accusations of unnatural lust alleged to have been brought by
the tribunes of the plebs before the same comitia: (1) that
against L. Papirius, 326,<a id="FNanchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> (2) that against L. or M. Laetorius
Mergus, a military tribune, quod cornicularium suum stupri
causa appellasset,<a id="FNanchor_1496" href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a> (3) the case mentioned by Pliny and others
against a person of unknown name, which probably belongs to
this period.<a id="FNanchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a> The second case seems to be a trial of official
accountability, which fell within tribunician jurisdiction according
to the usage of historical time; the others are too little
known to be legally formulated.</p>

<p>In this period falls the attempted prosecution of Appius
Claudius Caecus, 310, on the ground that he had not laid down
the censorship at the end of the limit of eighteen months.<a id="FNanchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a>
The accusing tribune ordered him to be seized and imprisoned,
but three colleagues interceded.<a id="FNanchor_1499" href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a> About the same time M.
Atilius Calatinus was unsuccessfully prosecuted on a charge of
having betrayed Sora,<a id="FNanchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a> probably in connection with the defection
of that town to the Samnites in 315.<a id="FNanchor_1501" href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a></p>

<p>In reviewing the cases said to have been brought by tribunes
before the comitia centuriata it is surprising to find the period
from the institution of the office to the trial of Q. Fabius, 390,
swarming with such prosecutions, whereas for the century
intervening between that date and the Hortensian legislation
comparatively few cases are recorded and those of little significance.<a id="FNanchor_1502" href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a>
These circumstances tend to prove that the cases assigned
to the earlier and less known period either belong mostly
to the jurisdiction of the duumviri or of the quaestors rather
than of the tribunes, or are in great part mythical, and that the
tribunes, therefore, exercised no extensive capital jurisdiction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
before the enactment of the Hortensian law.<a id="FNanchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a> We are led
thence to the conclusion that either by an article of the statute
of Hortensius or at least as a recognized consequence of the
high place in the government assured the tribunes by it, the
jurisdiction of these magistrates in political cases was freed from
every restraint. At this time they succeeded wholly to the
place of the duumviri. The cases of which the tribunes had
cognizance were thereafter exclusively political, whereas the
questorian jurisdiction was confined to murder and other common
crimes. This distinction was not a limitation upon the
power of the tribunes, who if they chose might have superseded
the quaestors as easily as they had superseded the duumviri.
It was rather a division of functions adopted by the tribunes
themselves in view of their own political character and on the
basis of the relative dignity of the two offices. The chief
judicial function of the tribunes, accordingly, was to hold officials
responsible for their administration, though occasionally
they called private persons to account for their conduct as citizens.
All grades of officials were within their jurisdiction, but
most of the cases were against the higher magistrates.</p>

<p>The first tribunician case of the kind after the Hortensian
legislation, and the first which is absolutely free from historical
doubt, is that brought against P. Claudius Pulcher on the ground
that as consul, 249, he fought the naval battle off Drepana
contrary to auspices, thereby losing his fleet. After the comitia
had been interrupted by a storm, the intercession of colleagues
against the resumption of the trial saved him from the death
penalty. As the result of a new trial before the tribes, however,
he was fined 120,000 asses, 1000 for each ship lost.<a id="FNanchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a> His
colleague, L. Junius, by suicide escaped condemnation on a
charge of perduellio.<a id="FNanchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a> In 212 two tribunes of the plebs prosecuted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
M. Postumius Pyrgensis, a publican, before the tribes for
fraud, setting the penalty at 200,000 asses; but the accused
with his friends violently broke up the assembly, whereupon the
tribunes, dropping the original charge, prosecuted him for perduellio,<a id="FNanchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a>
we should suppose before the centuries.<a id="FNanchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a> Among the
complaints urged against him by the consuls in the senate were
that “he had wrested from the Roman people the right of suffrage,
had broken up a concilium plebis, had reduced the tribunes
to the rank of private persons, had marshalled an army
against the Roman people, seized a position, and cut the tribunes
off from the plebs, and had prevented the tribes from being
called to vote.” Specifically the crime must have been perduellio.<a id="FNanchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a>
Before the day of trial he withdrew into exile. In
his absence the plebs on the motion of Sp. and L. Carvilius
decreed that he was legally in banishment, that his property
should be confiscated, and that he should be interdicted from
fire and water. In this connection it should be noticed that
whereas the banishment of a citizen by lex or iudicium was the
exclusive right of the centuries,<a id="FNanchor_1509" href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a> the tribes were competent to
decree him an exile after his voluntary retirement.<a id="FNanchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a> Some of
the coadjutors in the violence of the publican above mentioned
left their bail and followed him into exile; others were imprisoned
to await capital trial, with what result the historian does
not inform us.<a id="FNanchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a></p>

<p>In the same year Cn. Fulvius, a praetor, met with military reverses
through gross cowardice,<a id="FNanchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a> and in the following was prosecuted
in a finable action by a tribune of the plebs for having
corrupted his army by the example of his unsoldierly habits.
Finding in the course of the trial that the fault of the magistrate
was far more serious than had been imagined, and that the people
were in a temper to vote the extreme penalty, the prosecutor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
changed the form of accusation to perduellio on the ground that
such cowardly conduct in a commander threatened the existence
of the state. In this instance, too, the accused avoided trial by
withdrawing into exile.<a id="FNanchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a> In 204 by a decree of the senate a
special commission, consisting of the praetor for Sicily with a
council of ten senators,<a id="FNanchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a> was appointed for the trial of a legate
of Scipio, Q. Pleminius, on the charge that he had robbed the
temple of Persephone in Locri and had violently oppressed the
Locrians.<a id="FNanchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a> The commission brought him and his accomplices
in chains to Rome and cast them in prison to await their trial
for life before the centuries.<a id="FNanchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a> The day of trial was continually
deferred, till finally Pleminius, now charged with the instigation
of a plot to burn the city, was put to death in prison.<a id="FNanchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a> The fate
of his accomplices is unknown.<a id="FNanchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a> Livy<a id="FNanchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a> remarks that while
Pleminius was languishing in jail the wrath of the populace
gradually changed to sympathy, to such an extent doubtless as
to convince the authorities of their inability to secure a popular
verdict in favor of the death penalty. In fact since the death
of M. Manlius Capitolinus, 384, no example of the execution of
a death sentence pronounced by the assembly is recorded in
history.<a id="FNanchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a> But the magistrate probably often inflicted corporal
punishment in violation of the third Valerian law. To put an
end to this abuse, and at the same time to embody in legal form
the popular feeling against the application of the death penalty
to citizens, a Porcian law absolutely forbade the scourging or
slaying of a citizen under the imperium domi, the article prohibiting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
the sentence of death being afterward reënforced by
other enactments.<a id="FNanchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a> There has been much discussion as to the
authorship of this law; probably it was the work of M. Porcius
Cato the Elder in his praetorship, 198.<a id="FNanchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a> Another Porcian law,
probably of P. Porcius Laeca, praetor in 195, extended the right
of appeal to Roman citizens who were engaged in the affairs of
peace outside the city, in Italy and the provinces, and were
therefore under the military imperium.<a id="FNanchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a> According to this law
the citizen who appealed was sent to Rome for trial by the appropriate
civil authorities. Still later the third Porcian law,
which Lange<a id="FNanchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a> conjecturally assigns to L. Porcius Licinus, consul
in the year of the elder Cato’s censorship, 184, seems to have
been passed for the benefit of Roman soldiers. We learn from
Polybius,<a id="FNanchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a> who wrote later than the date last mentioned, that
the military tribunes were accustomed in court-martial to condemn
common soldiers for neglect of sentinel duty and that the
condemned were cudgeled and stoned, often to death, by their
fellow-soldiers. He also speaks of the punishment of entire
maniples by decimation. Under Scipio Aemilianus, 133, the
Roman who neglected duty was flogged with vine stocks, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
foreigner with cudgels.<a id="FNanchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a> Cicero<a id="FNanchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a> intimates that in his own time
there was no appeal from the judgment of commanders; and
in fact it is impossible to understand how discipline could otherwise
be maintained. Evidence to the contrary is scant and uncertain.
The person against whom an accusation of desertion
was brought before the tribunes of the plebs in 138 seems to
have claimed to be a civilian, and on that ground appealed to
the tribunes. When proved guilty he was flogged and sold as a
slave, probably by a judgment of the military authorities.<a id="FNanchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a> In
122 Livius Drusus proposed to exempt Latin soldiers from flogging.<a id="FNanchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a>
While informing us that in 108 a commander had a right
to scourge and put to death a Latin official, Sallust<a id="FNanchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a> intimates
that he had less authority over a Roman. In the time of the
emperors, on the other hand, soldiers were subject to the death
penalty as in the time of Polybius.<a id="FNanchor_1531" href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a> All these circumstances
may be best explained by supposing that the third Porcian law
permitted the infliction of flogging and death on Roman soldiers
by the judgment only of a court-martial.<a id="FNanchor_1532" href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a> This difficult subject
is further complicated by the statement of Cicero<a id="FNanchor_1533" href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a> that the
three Porcian statutes introduced nothing new excepting by
way of penalty. Interpreted in the light of other information
given by various authors, including Cicero himself, these
statutes simply extended the right of appeal by adapting the
Valerian principle to new conditions, and substituted exile in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
place of scourging and death. In the relation between the accused
and the civil court the cry “civis Romanus sum” was
thereafter a sufficient protection from bodily injury.<a id="FNanchor_1534" href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a></p>

<p>In the period to which the Porcian laws belong falls the accusation
of perduellio brought by the tribune P. Rutilius Rufus
against the censors C. Claudius and Ti. Sempronius Gracchus,
while they were in office, 169. The charge against Gracchus
was disregard of the tribunician auxilium, against his colleague
the interruption of a concilium plebis (quod contionem ab se
avocasset). The accused, foregoing the privilege of their magistracy,
consented to a trial, which came before the comitia
centuriata. Claudius narrowly escaped condemnation, whereupon
the case against Gracchus was dropped.<a id="FNanchor_1535" href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a></p>

<p>The increasing number of special judiciary commissions and
the institution of standing courts limited more and more the
judicial activity of the centuriate assembly; but the tribunes
of the plebs kept alive the feeling of popular sovereignty in
this sphere by the occasional prosecution of some notorious
offender.<a id="FNanchor_1536" href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">[1536]</a> The continuance of the centuriate judicial function
is proved by the Cassian plebiscite of 137, which provided for
the use of the ballot in all iudicia populi excepting in perduellio,<a id="FNanchor_1537" href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">[1537]</a>
and by the lex Caelia, 108, which removed the exception.<a id="FNanchor_1538" href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor">[1538]</a></p>

<p>The limitation upon popular jurisdiction by the special court
is said to have begun as early as 414, when, according to Livy,<a id="FNanchor_1539" href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor">[1539]</a>
a senatus consultum authorized the appointment of a quaestio
extraordinaria to discover and punish the murderers of M. Postumius,
a tribune of the soldiers with consular power. The
plebs, consulted as to the presidency of the court, left it to the
consuls. The instance may be an anticipation of later usage.
The case of wholesale poisoning by Roman matrons, 331, was
investigated, and a hundred and seventy matrons were condemned,
by an extraordinary court, which evidently owed its
existence to a senatus consultum without the coöperation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
the people.<a id="FNanchor_1540" href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">[1540]</a> The same is true of the quaestio appointed by
the senate under dictatorial presidency in 314 to inquire into
charges of conspiracy of the leading men in certain allied
states. The dictator extended the inquiry to Rome, and after
his resignation the consuls continued the work. Livy’s account
of this affair assumes that the senate had full power to appoint
such commissions.<a id="FNanchor_1541" href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a> It did in fact possess the right without
the coöperation of the people to institute quaestiones extraordinariae
for the trial of allies or other aliens in crimes which
menaced the security of Rome. In the period between the
Hortensian legislation and the Gracchi in two recorded instances
it dared on its own responsibility to appoint such courts
for the trial of citizens.<a id="FNanchor_1542" href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a> These were usurpations; for as the
laws of appeal forbade the putting to death of a citizen unless
condemned by the people, a special court with capital jurisdiction
over citizens could not be constitutionally established
excepting with the consent of the assembly. This right of the
people was considered a legislative equivalent of their judicial
power, which the vast expansion of their state made it impossible
for them directly to exercise.<a id="FNanchor_1543" href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">[1543]</a> The court which tried and
condemned the insurgent garrison of Rhegium in 270 was
instituted accordingly by a plebiscite authorized by a senatus
consultum.<a id="FNanchor_1544" href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a> Most probably the court in this case was the
senate itself, just as in 210, when the plebiscite of L. Atilius
gave it full power to judge and punish the Campanians for
revolt.<a id="FNanchor_1545" href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">[1545]</a> The appointment of special courts for the detection
and punishment of aliens for illegal usurpation of the citizenship,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
which belonged originally to the senate, began in 177 to
be shared by the people.<a id="FNanchor_1546" href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">[1546]</a></p>

<p>Similar in character to the special judiciary commission appointed
by the senate, but far more sweeping in effect, was the
senatus consultum ultimum (“videant consules, ne quid respublica
detrimenti capiat”), which in crises armed the consuls
with absolute power of life and death over the citizens.<a id="FNanchor_1547" href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor">[1547]</a> By
these means the senate at its pleasure circumvented the laws of
appeal on the plea that the accused had ceased to be citizens.<a id="FNanchor_1548" href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a>
Against this abuse Ti. Gracchus planned a new law of appeal,
which he did not live to see enacted.<a id="FNanchor_1549" href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a> His own followers were
ruthlessly condemned without the privilege of appeal by an
extraordinary quaestio under P. Popillius Laenas, consul in 132.<a id="FNanchor_1550" href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a>
Probably a similar court was appointed after the revolt of
Fregellae.<a id="FNanchor_1551" href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a> To put an end to such circumvention of a well-established
right of the people, C. Gracchus in his first tribunate,
123, carrying into effect the plan of his brother, passed
the often mentioned lex Sempronia de provocatione, which absolutely
forbade capital sentence upon a citizen without an order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
of the people.<a id="FNanchor_1552" href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a> The wording indicates that it was intended not
to do away with extraordinary courts and powers, but to allow
their establishment in no other way than by popular vote.<a id="FNanchor_1553" href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">[1553]</a> It
reiterated, too, the article of the Porcian statute which absolutely
forbade the infliction of the death penalty on civilians.<a id="FNanchor_1554" href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">[1554]</a> Far,
however, from transferring the jurisdiction of the assembly to
the quaestiones, the Sempronian law evidently confirmed the
right of the people by enacting that the tribunes might bring
the violator of that law before the comitia on a charge of perduellio,
for which it mentioned the penalty of interdict from
fire and water.<a id="FNanchor_1555" href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">[1555]</a> It held responsible not only the magistrate
charged with the extraordinary commission, but probably also
the senator who moved or supported the measure which called
it into being.<a id="FNanchor_1556" href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">[1556]</a> The entire Sempronian law was made retroactive,
so as to cover the case of Popillius, who thereupon fled into
exile to avoid trial. The interdict was accordingly decreed by
the tribes on the motion of Gaius.<a id="FNanchor_1557" href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">[1557]</a> Rupilius, the colleague of
Popillius, seems to have suffered a similar punishment.<a id="FNanchor_1558" href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">[1558]</a></p>

<p>In 120 the tribune Decius prosecuted for perduellio L. Opimius,
who, as consul in 121, armed with the senatus consultum
ultimum, had caused the death of C. Gracchus. The accused
was acquitted.<a id="FNanchor_1559" href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">[1559]</a> Ihne<a id="FNanchor_1560" href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a> considers this prosecution to have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
instigated by the optimates in order to settle once for all and in
their favor the question as to the legality of special courts which
were called into being by an act of the senate alone. In that
case acquittal was a foregone conclusion. In 119 the popular
party met with greater success in the prosecution of C. Papirius
Carbo, whom it hated as a renegade.<a id="FNanchor_1561" href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">[1561]</a> The charge was probably
perduellio, though the details are unknown.<a id="FNanchor_1562" href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">[1562]</a></p>

<p>The jurisdiction of the comitia in criminal cases suffered
more extensive curtailment from the standing courts,—quaestiones
perpetuae,—the first of which was established in 149
for the trial of Roman officials accused of extortion—repetundae—committed
in the provinces or in Italy.<a id="FNanchor_1563" href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">[1563]</a> As the object
of the prosecutors was in the main the recovery of extorted
property, the court was essentially civil, and seemed, therefore,
to the Romans no infringement of popular rights; yet even
before Sulla the principle began to apply to distinctly criminal
cases.<a id="FNanchor_1564" href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">[1564]</a> Notwithstanding this development several accusations
were brought before the centuriate assembly in the period between
the Gracchi and Sulla.<a id="FNanchor_1565" href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor">[1565]</a> The latter increased the number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
of quaestiones to seven and brought all crimes within their
cognizance. The questorian jurisdiction in cases of murder
had already passed to the quaestio inter sicarios, established
between 149 and 141;<a id="FNanchor_1566" href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">[1566]</a> and now Sulla transferred cases of perduellio
from the jurisdiction of the tribunes to the quaestio
maiestatis.<a id="FNanchor_1567" href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor">[1567]</a> Although restored to the tribunes in 70, it was
for the remainder of the republican period exercised by them
on special occasions only, for the quaestio maiestatis still existed.
With the establishment of the principate the jurisdiction of the
people finally vanished.<a id="FNanchor_1568" href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor">[1568]</a></p>

<p>The revolutionary character of the period after Sulla is
illustrated by the case of perduellio against C. Rabirius<a id="FNanchor_1569" href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor">[1569]</a>
brought in 63 by a tribune of the plebs, T. Atius Labienus.
Rabirius was charged with complicity in the murder of L.
Appuleius Saturninus, the famous tribune of the year 100.
Labienus proposed and carried a plebiscite requiring the praetor
to appoint duumviri for the trial, whereas it was generally
held at the time that these officials should have been elected by
the people. It was also enacted, in violation of the Porcian and
Sempronian laws, that in case of conviction the accused should
be crucified on the Campus Martius. C. and L. Caesar, appointed
duumviri, brought the case before the comitia centuriata,
which were prevented from giving their verdict by the removal
of the flag from Janiculum.<a id="FNanchor_1570" href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor">[1570]</a> The object of the trial was not to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
punish the guilty, but to discredit the senate, to which the
accused belonged.<a id="FNanchor_1571" href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">[1571]</a> The decline of the idea of popular sovereignty
is further indicated by the agrarian rogation of the
tribune P. Servilius Rullus, 63, an article of which, in violation
of the lex Valeria Horatia de provocatione, ordered the appointment
of decemviri agris adsignandis without appeal.<a id="FNanchor_1572" href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">[1572]</a></p>

<p>The procedure was the same in all finable and capital
actions. In a case subject to appeal the magistrate, after a
preliminary inquiry (quaestio), summoned the people to contio
on the third day<a id="FNanchor_1573" href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">[1573]</a> for a thorough examination (anquisitio).<a id="FNanchor_1574" href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">[1574]</a>
The trumpeter blew his horn before the door of the accused,
and cited him to appear at daybreak in the place of assembly.<a id="FNanchor_1575" href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor">[1575]</a>
Acting as accuser, the magistrate addressed the contio and
produced his witnesses. Then came the witnesses for the
defence, the statement of the accused, and the pleading of his
counsel. These proceedings filled three contiones separated
from one another by a day’s interval. At the end of the third
day’s session the magistrate acquitted the accused or condemned
him and fixed the penalty. In case of condemnation,
the accused if dissatisfied appealed. The magistrate then put
his sentence in the form of a rogation and set a date for the
comitia,<a id="FNanchor_1576" href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor">[1576]</a> which could be held only after an interval of a trinum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
nundinum,<a id="FNanchor_1577" href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">[1577]</a> unless the accused desired an earlier trial.<a id="FNanchor_1578" href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">[1578]</a> Some
scholars, however, hold the theory that a magistrate, recognizing
the limitation of his competence, might bring the case
directly to the comitia without the formality of a condemnation
and appeal.<a id="FNanchor_1579" href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor">[1579]</a> The penalty proposed in the rogation was not
necessarily the same as at first announced; for the trial might
bring to light facts to mitigate or to aggravate the sentence.
The presentation of the case to the comitia by the magistrate
was termed the fourth accusation.<a id="FNanchor_1580" href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a> If anything prevented the
voting in the comitia, the accused was discharged,<a id="FNanchor_1581" href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a> and could
not be legally brought to trial again for the same offence excepting
under a different form of action.<a id="FNanchor_1582" href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor">[1582]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE COMITIA TRIBUTA AND THE RISE OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY<br />
<span class="smcap">To the Year 449</span></span></h3>

</div>

<p>In the belief of the Romans the tribunes of the plebs, originally
two, were instituted in 494 as a concession to the seceding
commons to win them back to the state.<a id="FNanchor_1583" href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor">[1583]</a> The historical
truth of the first secession need not be discussed here; but
there is no good ground for rejecting the view of the ancients
either that the tribunate of the plebs owed its existence to a
revolution or that it began at as early a date. According to
our sources the plebeian tribunes, hence we may infer also the
aediles, were for a time elected, and other business affecting
the interests of the common people was transacted, in comitia
curiata composed potentially of all the citizens.<a id="FNanchor_1584" href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor">[1584]</a> The change
in the form of organization in 471, from curiate to tribal, will
be considered below. The president of the comitia which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
elected the first plebeian tribunes was necessarily a patrician
magistrate,<a id="FNanchor_1585" href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor">[1585]</a> probably the pontifex maximus;<a id="FNanchor_1586" href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor">[1586]</a> thereafter, with
the exception of the comitia for the election of the first plebeian
officials after the overthrow of the decemvirs, tribunes of the
plebs presided not only for elections but also for judicial business
and for the enactment of plebiscites (plebi scita).</p>

<p>The object of the office of tribune was the protection of individual
citizens, plebeian and patrician alike,<a id="FNanchor_1587" href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor">[1587]</a> from oppression; and
the means was the auxilium (official aid),<a id="FNanchor_1588" href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor">[1588]</a> which could be rendered
in no other way than by personal contact; hence the law prohibiting
a tribune from being absent over night from the city<a id="FNanchor_1589" href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor">[1589]</a> and requiring
him to leave the door of his house open during the night.<a id="FNanchor_1590" href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor">[1590]</a>
In the further interest of the citizens the tribunes had the unrestricted
right to call the plebs to a contio and address them at
any time and on any subject, to form them when so assembled
into voting groups, at first curiae and after 471, tribes, and to
take their votes on proposals affecting plebeian interests, plebiscites
being from the beginning binding on the plebeian body
in so far as they harmonized with the laws of the state.<a id="FNanchor_1591" href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor">[1591]</a></p>

<p>These were the two original functions from which the vast
powers of the later tribunes gradually developed. As strictly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
plebeian officials they had no authority to summon patricians,
to exclude them from the place of assembly,<a id="FNanchor_1592" href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">[1592]</a> or to condemn
them judicially.<a id="FNanchor_1593" href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor">[1593]</a> It follows that their alleged prosecutions of
past consuls for maladministration<a id="FNanchor_1594" href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor">[1594]</a> are fictions<a id="FNanchor_1595" href="#Footnote_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a>—an anticipation
of their jurisdiction at a later age. Directly they possessed
no power of judgment or of coercion;<a id="FNanchor_1596" href="#Footnote_1596" class="fnanchor">[1596]</a> but for the enforcement
of the auxilium and of the ius agendi cum plebe their persons
were made sacred—sacro sancti—by an oath which the plebs
swore at the time they instituted the office,<a id="FNanchor_1597" href="#Footnote_1597" class="fnanchor">[1597]</a> namely that any
one who killed a tribune or aedile of the plebs or did him
bodily harm, or who commanded another to inflict harm or death
upon him might as a person devoted to Jupiter be killed with
impunity, and his property be confiscated.<a id="FNanchor_1598" href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor">[1598]</a> The avenger was
necessarily either a private plebeian or an official of the plebs.<a id="FNanchor_1599" href="#Footnote_1599" class="fnanchor">[1599]</a>
The formal act which rendered the tribunes sacred was termed
a lex sacrata. The essence of such a law is (1) that it was
sworn to by the community—in this instance by the community<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
of plebs, (2) that the offender against it became a homo sacer
and could be put to death with impunity.<a id="FNanchor_1600" href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor">[1600]</a> This idea of sanctity
the plebeians may have derived partly from the Greek asylum;<a id="FNanchor_1601" href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor">[1601]</a>
but it seems also to have been influenced by the condition
of ambassadors, hence the later, ill-founded conception of the
plebs as a state, and of the plebeian officials and other institutions
as based on a treaty ratified with fetial ceremonies between
the patrician government and the seceding plebs.<a id="FNanchor_1602" href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor">[1602]</a> Though
termed lex sacrata because it was passed and sworn to in the
community, as it were, of the plebs, like any plebiscite of this
period the resolution had no legal validity for the state or for
the patricians. Under compulsion, however, the government
yielded to the demands of the plebeians without formally acknowledging
the sanctity of their officials; so that the patricians,
by asserting that Roman law did not recognize an inviolability
founded purely on religion,<a id="FNanchor_1603" href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor">[1603]</a> could afterward deny that
the tribunes were really sacrosanct. Till the enactment of the
Valerian-Horatian laws of 449,<a id="FNanchor_1604" href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor">[1604]</a> accordingly, the inviolability of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
the tribunes existed in so far only as the plebeians were in a
position to maintain it by holding over their opponents and over
the government the threat of violence and revolution. That
under the circumstances domestic peace was on the whole preserved
should be credited to the orderly character of the great
mass of citizens.</p>

<p>Applied to the holding of contiones and comitia, this inviolability
protected the presiding tribune from interruption, contradiction,
and every disturbance. The principle was afterward
extended to verbal abuse anywhere publicly indulged in.<a id="FNanchor_1605" href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor">[1605]</a> Even
if a man showed disrespect by not stepping out of the way of a
tribune who was passing along the street, he was liable to the
death penalty.<a id="FNanchor_1606" href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor">[1606]</a> Under normal conditions, however, the rigorous
execution of this lex sacrata could not be thought of; in
place of outlawing the offender against his person the tribune
was ordinarily willing to impose a fine upon him, from which an
appeal might be made to the plebeian assembly; or in cases of
violence to his person, he might resort to capital prosecution,
which was likewise appealable. These principles were formulated
in an alleged Icilian plebiscite of the year 492.<a id="FNanchor_1607" href="#Footnote_1607" class="fnanchor">[1607]</a> From
what has just been said it is clear that the tribune’s coercive<a id="FNanchor_1608" href="#Footnote_1608" class="fnanchor">[1608]</a>
and judicial functions resulted, not from usurpation as has often
been asserted,<a id="FNanchor_1609" href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor">[1609]</a> but from a mitigation of the harsh lex sacrata.
In a word, the ultimate basis of tribunician authority was the
revolutionary power of the plebs, upon which rested the sanctity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
of the tribunes, and thereon their jurisdiction. Of the judicial
activity attributed by the annalists to the plebeian officials in the
period before the decemvirs we do not know how much is mythical;
but it is safe to say that all the capital cases, probably all
the cases without qualification, which they actually settled as
judges were submitted to by the patrician government for the
sake of peace, without being accepted as legal.</p>

<p>To the third year of the tribunate, 491, is assigned the first
mentioned exercise of tribunician jurisdiction. C. Marcius Coriolanus,
the accused, had advocated in the senate the abolition
of the tribunician office,<a id="FNanchor_1610" href="#Footnote_1610" class="fnanchor">[1610]</a> and had done personal violence to the
aediles, in this way rendering himself liable to the penalty of
the lex sacrata on which rested the sanctity of the plebeian officials.
Instead of declaring him a homo sacer, a tribune brought
him to trial before the tribes, which condemned him by a narrow
majority.<a id="FNanchor_1611" href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor">[1611]</a> The story is now regarded by all scholars as a myth.
The vote by tribes at this early time is either exceptional or
more likely an anticipation of later usage.<a id="FNanchor_1612" href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor">[1612]</a></p>

<p>In accordance with the Icilian plebiscite a capital charge is
said to have been brought by a tribune of the plebs against
Kaeso Quinctius on the ground that he had repeatedly driven
the tribunes from the Forum and had dispersed their assembly.<a id="FNanchor_1613" href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor">[1613]</a>
After providing sureties the accused went into exile,<a id="FNanchor_1614" href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor">[1614]</a> and the
sentence of banishment was passed—in Cicero’s opinion by the
comitia centuriata, in Livy’s by the tribal comitia of plebs, 461.<a id="FNanchor_1615" href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor">[1615]</a>
Another case prior to the decemvirate is recorded for the year
455. Representatives of three illustrious patrician families were
charged with having disturbed an assembly under tribunician
presidency. Their estates were forfeited to Ceres.<a id="FNanchor_1616" href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor">[1616]</a> Naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
under this arrangement between the plebs and the government
there was room for much misunderstanding: the leaders of the
plebs stretched their claims to the uttermost; and the patricians,
after granting the radical concession, endeavored to recall as
much of it as possible. They plausibly urged that while the sacrosanctitas,
so far as it existed,<a id="FNanchor_1617" href="#Footnote_1617" class="fnanchor">[1617]</a> might protect the person of the
tribune, it gave him no authority over a patrician;<a id="FNanchor_1618" href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor">[1618]</a> and their position
as the sole holders of political power and the sole repositories
of law and usage enabled them before the decemviral legislation
by stubborn, skilful perseverance in the details of political
warfare almost to throw the tribunician sanctity into oblivion.<a id="FNanchor_1619" href="#Footnote_1619" class="fnanchor">[1619]</a>
Livy tells us that in the assembly appointed for the trial of the
past consuls L. Furius and C. Manlius, the accusing tribune
failed to appear, and was found murdered in his home; and the
historian gives us to understand that the crime was the result of
a private conference among the patricians.<a id="FNanchor_1620" href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor">[1620]</a> Dio Cassius<a id="FNanchor_1621" href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor">[1621]</a> states
that they secretly slew a number of the boldest spirits among
the plebeians. Though these stories are mythical, they reflect at
least the opinion of the historians that in this early period the
sanctity of the tribune counted for little. If it failed to protect
his person, it could have given him no great degree of recognized
judicial competence. Under these circumstances we
should not expect to find the tribunes often bringing the power
of their questioned sanctity into actual use in the early years of
their existence; but that before the decemvirate they exercised
jurisdiction to some extent even in capital cases, which were appealed
to the assembly under their presidency, is proved by a
law of the Twelve Tables, which, to remedy what the legislators
must have considered an abuse, provided that accusations affecting
the caput of a citizen should be brought only before the
comitiatus maximus—evidently the comitia centuriata.<a id="FNanchor_1622" href="#Footnote_1622" class="fnanchor">[1622]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>If the tribunes presumed to condemn men to death, they certainly
would not hesitate to fine them for lighter offences. For
checking the power of the magistrates to levy unlimited fines
the consuls of 454, A. Aternius and Sp. Tarpeius, passed
through the comitia centuriata a law which set the maximum
fine to be levied by a magistrate on an individual in any one
day at thirty cattle and two sheep, the minimum being a single
sheep. In case he exceeded the former amount, an appeal
could be made to the assembly.<a id="FNanchor_1623" href="#Footnote_1623" class="fnanchor">[1623]</a> In the opinion of Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_1624" href="#Footnote_1624" class="fnanchor">[1624]</a>
this law was interpreted to apply to all magistrates, including
those of the plebs, and was made accordingly the basis of the
tribunician jurisdiction in finable offences. These consequences
seem to have been drawn from the statute, although the proposers
may not have so intended it.<a id="FNanchor_1625" href="#Footnote_1625" class="fnanchor">[1625]</a></p>

<p>Sufficient evidence has now been offered that before the
decemviral legislation the plebeian tribunes exercised, on the
basis of their sanctity, a vague jurisdiction in both finable and
capital cases, occasionally submitted to by the patrician government
though probably not recognized by it as just or constitutional.
For the same period their method of agitation by the
obstruction of the levy,<a id="FNanchor_1626" href="#Footnote_1626" class="fnanchor">[1626]</a> by haranguing the people in contiones,<a id="FNanchor_1627" href="#Footnote_1627" class="fnanchor">[1627]</a>
and occasionally by sedition, proves clearly the lack of legislative
power through the assembly over which they presided, as
well as their lack of veto on the acts of the government. With
reference to legislation the course of the discussion in the
present and following chapters will make it evident that only
by a provision of the Hortensian statute did plebiscites become
unconditionally binding on the whole people. Although from
the beginning a tribune, as a member of a collegial office,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
could intercede against the act of a colleague, he had in this
period no legal right of the kind against the government; for
had he now possessed it, as he did at a later age, he would have
felt no need of obstructing the levy—a relatively slow, clumsy
method of political warfare. It is to be noticed further that
the power of veto of the tribunes, after it had been acquired,
rested upon their jurisdiction. If a magistrate persisted in
ignoring their prohibition, his act remained valid but he rendered
himself liable to tribunician prosecution.<a id="FNanchor_1628" href="#Footnote_1628" class="fnanchor">[1628]</a> Necessarily,
then, as long as the tribunes lacked judicial competence (till
the Valerian-Horatian legislation, 449) they lacked the veto
against governmental action; as long as their judicial competence
depended upon the will of the government (probably till
the Hortensian legislation, 287), their veto on the government
must have been correspondingly limited. Finally it was not
till tribunician obstruction of the levy, sedition, and secession
disappear (that is, with the enactment of the Hortensian statute)
that we have a right to assume the existence of an unrestricted
tribunician veto.<a id="FNanchor_1629" href="#Footnote_1629" class="fnanchor">[1629]</a> The method of the tribunes in the pre-decemviral
period was, by the means above indicated, to force a
proposed measure upon the patrician magistrates, and to compel
them to bring it before the centuriate assembly in regular
form.<a id="FNanchor_1630" href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor">[1630]</a></p>

<p>In view of the circumstances that passed bills alone were
recorded and hence could be known to posterity, we may reject
as unauthentic all the alleged proposals of agrarian laws of
this period,<a id="FNanchor_1631" href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor">[1631]</a> which however may not have been free from agitation
of the kind.</p>

<p>A law of the year 471 gave the tribunician assembly a tribal
organization. This measure, brought about by the agitation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
Publilius Volero, tribune of the plebs of that year,<a id="FNanchor_1632" href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor">[1632]</a> must, for
the reason above mentioned, have been an act of the comitia
centuriata.<a id="FNanchor_1633" href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor">[1633]</a> The motive given by Livy was the desire of the
tribunes to free themselves from the influence which the patricians
through the votes of their clients exercised on the assembly.<a id="FNanchor_1634" href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor">[1634]</a>
The curiae contained all the citizens,<a id="FNanchor_1635" href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor">[1635]</a> the tribes none but
the landowners. The tribal organization, therefore, excluded
not all the clients but those only, together with any other citizens,
who were landless.<a id="FNanchor_1636" href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor">[1636]</a> Probably in other ways the patricians
had greater control of the curiate than of the tribal assemblies,
although it is impossible to believe with Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_1637" href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor">[1637]</a> that the
essence of the change from the curiate to the tribal comitia consisted
in the elimination of auspical influence. That the law
forbade the patricians to take part in tribunician assemblies, as
Zonaras<a id="FNanchor_1638" href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor">[1638]</a> imagines, is not probable, for it gave the tribune no
new authority over the patricians; he had power neither to
summon them to his assembly nor to expel them from it.<a id="FNanchor_1639" href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor">[1639]</a> In
fact we have evidence of the presence of patricians in tribunician
assemblies after this date.<a id="FNanchor_1640" href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor">[1640]</a> The so-called law of Publilius
Volero, now under discussion, was confused by the sources with
the Publilian law of 339, some of the provisions of the later act
being uncritically assigned to the earlier.<a id="FNanchor_1641" href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor">[1641]</a></p>

<p>The statute of 471 imparted to the tribunician assembly no
new function. Although in mentioning the bill Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_1642" href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor">[1642]</a>
includes a proposal to grant the assembly legislative power,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
when he comes to speak of the statute as actually passed, he
refers only to its provisions for the election of plebeian tribunes
and aediles by the tribes, herein agreeing with Livy and other
authorities.<a id="FNanchor_1643" href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor">[1643]</a></p>

<p>In the same year four tribunes of the plebs were elected for
the first time.<a id="FNanchor_1644" href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor">[1644]</a> The increase was probably effected by an article
of the statute under discussion.</p>

<p>Till after the decemviral legislation the comitia tributa,<a id="FNanchor_1645" href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor">[1645]</a>
brought into existence by the statute of 471, was restricted, as
had been the tribunician comitia curiata, to the transaction of
purely plebeian business. In the records of this period we find
a continuance of apocryphal agrarian bills<a id="FNanchor_1646" href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor">[1646]</a> and condemnations
of retired magistrates.<a id="FNanchor_1647" href="#Footnote_1647" class="fnanchor">[1647]</a> In reality the only political weapon of
the tribunes, aside from general agitation, continued to be the
obstruction of the levy,<a id="FNanchor_1648" href="#Footnote_1648" class="fnanchor">[1648]</a> as is proved by their increase in
number to ten.<a id="FNanchor_1649" href="#Footnote_1649" class="fnanchor">[1649]</a> The only agrarian law of the period, the
so-called lex Icilia for the division of the Aventine among the
people, was passed by the comitia centuriata.<a id="FNanchor_1650" href="#Footnote_1650" class="fnanchor">[1650]</a> The very circumstance
that this mild concession to the plebs was couched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
in a lex sacrata<a id="FNanchor_1651" href="#Footnote_1651" class="fnanchor">[1651]</a> shows how little faith the commons had in the
government.<a id="FNanchor_1652" href="#Footnote_1652" class="fnanchor">[1652]</a></p>

<p>During this period the supreme power was the senate.
Shortly after the fall of the kings it provided for the purchase
of corn among neighboring states in a time of scarcity, made a
state monopoly of salt in the interest of the poor, freed the plebs
from port dues and tributum, thereby placing the whole burden
of these taxes on the wealthy.<a id="FNanchor_1653" href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor">[1653]</a> These acts imply legislative as
well as administrative competence. Foreign affairs,<a id="FNanchor_1654" href="#Footnote_1654" class="fnanchor">[1654]</a> including
the decision of war and peace, were in its hands. It resolved
not to restore the property of the Tarquins,<a id="FNanchor_1655" href="#Footnote_1655" class="fnanchor">[1655]</a> decreed triumphs
to victorious generals,<a id="FNanchor_1656" href="#Footnote_1656" class="fnanchor">[1656]</a> the celebration of games,<a id="FNanchor_1657" href="#Footnote_1657" class="fnanchor">[1657]</a> the expulsion
of the Volscians from the city in the time of a festival,<a id="FNanchor_1658" href="#Footnote_1658" class="fnanchor">[1658]</a> controlled
the magistrates, including the plebeian tribunate, by
means of the dictatorship,<a id="FNanchor_1659" href="#Footnote_1659" class="fnanchor">[1659]</a> or clothed the consuls with absolute
authority.<a id="FNanchor_1660" href="#Footnote_1660" class="fnanchor">[1660]</a> Little room was left for the activity of the assemblies.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these unfavorable conditions the tribunes of
the plebs through obstruction of the levy and through their harangues
in contiones<a id="FNanchor_1661" href="#Footnote_1661" class="fnanchor">[1661]</a> were chiefly instrumental in bringing about
the institution of the decemviri legibus scribundis. Actual votes
in tribunician comitia on proposals looking to that end<a id="FNanchor_1662" href="#Footnote_1662" class="fnanchor">[1662]</a> could
have had no more than moral weight. Under popular pressure
the consul Sestius, 452, referred the question to the senate,<a id="FNanchor_1663" href="#Footnote_1663" class="fnanchor">[1663]</a> and
the bill for their institution was passed by comitia, doubtless
of the centuries. The only valid activity, therefore, of the tribal
assembly prior to the decemviral legislation, so far as is known,
was the enactment of plebiscites, which lacked the force of law,
the election of plebeian officials,<a id="FNanchor_1664" href="#Footnote_1664" class="fnanchor">[1664]</a> and the quasi-judicial decision<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
of cases appealed to it by those who were accused of violating
the tribunician sanctity.<a id="FNanchor_1665" href="#Footnote_1665" class="fnanchor">[1665]</a></p>

<p>An epoch was made in the history of the tribunate and of the
tribal assembly by the consulship of Valerius and Horatius, 449,
who proposed and carried a centuriate law<a id="FNanchor_1666" href="#Footnote_1666" class="fnanchor">[1666]</a> which gave these
institutions a legal basis. The article which logically first claims
our attention provided that any one who injured the tribunes of
the plebs, the aediles, or the decemviral judges should be
devoted to Jupiter, and his property should be forfeit to the
temple of Ceres, Liber, and Libera.<a id="FNanchor_1667" href="#Footnote_1667" class="fnanchor">[1667]</a> According to Livy,<a id="FNanchor_1668" href="#Footnote_1668" class="fnanchor">[1668]</a> who
here represents the tribunician point of view, the original lex
sacrata, passed on the Sacred Mount, was first renewed with appropriate
ceremonies, thus reëstablishing the religious inviolability
of the plebeian officials, whom then the article of the
Valerian-Horatian statute here mentioned rendered legally inviolable.
The constitutional relation of these two ideas was
difficult even for the Romans to determine. Certain jurists,
controverting the tribunician interpretation, asserted that this law
made no person sacrosanct, but merely threatened with capital
punishment any one who injured the officials concerned, clothing
them thus in the same kind of inviolability as that which
protected the ordinary magistrates.<a id="FNanchor_1669" href="#Footnote_1669" class="fnanchor">[1669]</a> The object, according to
this view, was not only to eliminate from the government the
anomaly of a power sanctioned by religion only,<a id="FNanchor_1670" href="#Footnote_1670" class="fnanchor">[1670]</a> but also to
convert the plebeian officials into state officials. The leaders of
the plebs gladly accepted the new position tendered them, without
being willing however to withdraw from the old. Henceforth
we have to deal, accordingly, with a group of legally recognized
public functionaries who effectively claimed a religious
inviolability hard to reconcile with the constitution, in which
they were in time to make for themselves a disproportionate
place.</p>

<p>The second article of the Valerian-Horatian statute was to the
effect that “whatever the plebs ordered in their tribal assembly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
should be valid for the people”;<a id="FNanchor_1671" href="#Footnote_1671" class="fnanchor">[1671]</a> so that henceforth plebiscites,
when passed under the conditions hereafter specified, were the
equivalent of leges, as they were often so called. It is so similar
to a provision of the later Publilian and of the still later
Hortensian statute that we should incline to reject it as an anticipation
of the one or the other, were it not for the fact that
under it important plebi scita, as the Canuleian, the Licinian-Sextian,
and the Genucian, were passed.<a id="FNanchor_1672" href="#Footnote_1672" class="fnanchor">[1672]</a> We must accept it,
then, as historical, and adapt our interpretation to the few
known facts in the case.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the use of the word plebs to designate the
tribal gathering under tribunician presidency, there is no valid
reason for supposing that the Valerian-Horatian law altered its
composition—that the patricians were now excluded.<a id="FNanchor_1673" href="#Footnote_1673" class="fnanchor">[1673]</a> Dionysius<a id="FNanchor_1674" href="#Footnote_1674" class="fnanchor">[1674]</a>
is clearly of the opinion that they participated in this form
of comitia both before and after the enactment of the statute
under consideration; and Livy<a id="FNanchor_1675" href="#Footnote_1675" class="fnanchor">[1675]</a> thinks of them as still present
in the tribunician meetings as late as the struggle for the Licinian-Sextian
laws. The problem must be considered in connection
with the development of the voting function of the assembly.
Primitively the leaders (nobles) in council decided upon a measure,
which they then submitted to the people to be accepted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
with clamor and din.<a id="FNanchor_1676" href="#Footnote_1676" class="fnanchor">[1676]</a> Although the acclamation was essentially
an act of the masses, nothing forbade the nobles to join
in the shouting. Doubtless in the tribal assemblies the expression
of opinion within the tribe continued for a time to be by
acclamation.<a id="FNanchor_1677" href="#Footnote_1677" class="fnanchor">[1677]</a> As long as this primitive condition existed, a distinction
could not be drawn between the right to be present and
the right to join in the decision of questions brought before the
comitia. Undoubtedly the custom of voting by heads within
the tribe was an imitation of a usage adopted by the comitia
centuriata some time after the institution of the latter;<a id="FNanchor_1678" href="#Footnote_1678" class="fnanchor">[1678]</a> hence
we could not reasonably assume its use by the tribes so early
as the pre-decemviral period. The question therefore as to
whether the patricians, who were certainly present in meetings
of the tribes, enjoyed the right of voting in them could not have
arisen till after the decemviral legislation. The plebeians had
found it impossible by their own powers to exclude from their
assembly the landless clients, who were inferior to themselves.<a id="FNanchor_1679" href="#Footnote_1679" class="fnanchor">[1679]</a>
Much less could they exclude the nobles. If the presiding tribune
could not prevent their remaining after the people had
been formed into voting groups, he could not prevent their
voting. As the patricians, equally with the plebeians, belonged
to the tribes, the former, being men of superior privilege, could
not lawfully be debarred from meetings of their associations;
and if they chose to attend, it was not for the tribunes of the
plebs to decide as to the law in the matter. The word plebs in
the statute is susceptible of an easy explanation. As the comitia
curiata and comitia centuriata, under patrician presidents, had
from the beginning been termed populus, nothing could be more
natural than that from the time an assembly convened under
plebeian presidency for plebeian objects, the latter should by
way of distinction be termed plebs, even though the few patricians
were included. Ordinarily the plebeians must have
welcomed patricians to their assemblies, as the presence of
magistrates and senators and their sons added dignity and
weight to the proceedings. But when the patricians used all
their superior influence in both lawful and unlawful ways to
block a popular measure, the tribunes, naturally wishing then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
to exclude them, attempted to establish the principle that tribunician
assemblies were exclusively plebeian. This question was
settled by the law of Publilius Philo, 339.<a id="FNanchor_1680" href="#Footnote_1680" class="fnanchor">[1680]</a></p>

<p>This article of the Valerian-Horatian statute was a concession
extorted from the patrician government by the strongest
pressure, perhaps by a plebeian secession. The actual advantage
which it brought to the plebs was minimized, however,
by the provision that the previous consent of the senate was
essential to the validity of bills brought before the tribunician
assembly.<a id="FNanchor_1681" href="#Footnote_1681" class="fnanchor">[1681]</a> The patricians could urge in support of this arrangement
that as their magistrates according to long established
custom always obtained the previous consent of the
senate (senatus consultum) to measures brought before any
assembly, and were absolutely required to obtain senatorial
sanction (patrum auctoritas) for curiate and centuriate laws and
elections,<a id="FNanchor_1682" href="#Footnote_1682" class="fnanchor">[1682]</a> the tribunes, who were free from the trammels of
the sanction, should be legally compelled to consult the senate
before bringing a measure into their assemblies, especially as
their legislation was in a field hitherto monopolized by the
patrician magistrates and the senate. Although the tribunes of
the plebs would have preferred to understand by the term
plebiscite all that it had meant before—the unconditioned
resolution of the tribal assembly under their presidency—they
must have felt satisfied for the time being with the great gain
they had made, however strenuous they afterward became to
relieve themselves of senatorial control. This condition on the
validity of the plebiscite is not expressly mentioned by Livy in
connection with the Valerian-Horatian legislation, but is assumed
by the sources for the following period.<a id="FNanchor_1683" href="#Footnote_1683" class="fnanchor">[1683]</a> The same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
thing is clearly implied, too, in the long series of political
struggles which came after the enactment of the Valerian-Horatian
statute.<a id="FNanchor_1684" href="#Footnote_1684" class="fnanchor">[1684]</a> Had the tribunes been free to legislate without
interference on the part of the senate, they would have
been in a position easily to complete the social and political
equalization of the orders, and by one sweeping reform law
to place themselves and their constituents in the condition
reached by an almost uninterrupted conflict of a hundred and
sixty years (449-287).<a id="FNanchor_1685" href="#Footnote_1685" class="fnanchor">[1685]</a></p>

<p>It was in accordance with this regulation that another article
of the Valerian-Horatian statute directed the aediles of the plebs
to preserve the senatus consulta in the temple of Ceres.<a id="FNanchor_1686" href="#Footnote_1686" class="fnanchor">[1686]</a> We
cannot look upon these officials as keepers of the senatorial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
archives of that time,<a id="FNanchor_1687" href="#Footnote_1687" class="fnanchor">[1687]</a> and hence must conclude that the documents
in their charge were those decrees which authorized the
presentation of tribunician bills, for with those alone the plebeians
were directly concerned.</p>

<p>The patricians expected to find a further safeguard in the
tribunician veto, which could be directed against a colleague.<a id="FNanchor_1688" href="#Footnote_1688" class="fnanchor">[1688]</a>
From the fact, however, that the tribunes continued to resort to
the clumsy method of obstructing the levy, and afterward also of
impeding the collection of the tributum,<a id="FNanchor_1689" href="#Footnote_1689" class="fnanchor">[1689]</a> we must infer that as
yet their intercession did not prevail against a patrician magistrate.<a id="FNanchor_1690" href="#Footnote_1690" class="fnanchor">[1690]</a>
Various popular seditions, too, are mentioned for the
same period (449-287).<a id="FNanchor_1691" href="#Footnote_1691" class="fnanchor">[1691]</a> That one which led to the Hortensian
legislation is historical, and it is hardly possible that all the
others are fictions.</p>

<p>Another conservative check was the application of oblative
auspices to the plebeian assembly.<a id="FNanchor_1692" href="#Footnote_1692" class="fnanchor">[1692]</a> Livy<a id="FNanchor_1693" href="#Footnote_1693" class="fnanchor">[1693]</a> reports that in 293<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
the tribunes resigned because of a faulty election, held probably
in violation of oblativa. In general, however, the plebeian
gathering was relatively free from religious control till after the
enactment of the Aelian and Fufian laws (about 150).<a id="FNanchor_1694" href="#Footnote_1694" class="fnanchor">[1694]</a> It had
the advantage of the comitia centuriata (1) in freedom from the
impetrative auspices, (2) in freedom from the patrum auctoritas,
(3) in mobility. Immediately after the adoption of the Valerian-Horatian
statute it must have become evident that the tribunician
assembly, through the character of its presidency, its composition,
and its democratic spirit, was to outstrip the centuriate
gathering in energy and aggressiveness, and to be in a word the
chief factor of progress in legislation.</p>

<p>No enactment affecting the jurisdiction of tribunes is referred
to Valerius and Horatius by the ancient writers; and yet the
arrangement by which they thereafter brought their capital
actions before the centuries could not have been made without
the consent of the government. If, on the other hand, the
tribunes now possessed an unconditioned power to subject
patricians, whether magistrates or private citizens, to capital
prosecutions, they would have found it so effective a means of
political warfare as no longer to need obstruction and sedition
in their struggle for plebeian rights. In capital cases the permission
of a higher magistrate, ordinarily after 367 the praetor,
was required; and before the enactment of the Hortensian
statute, we may well believe, the tribunes had no means of forcing
this permission. Some similar restriction must have been
placed on their liberty to bring finable actions.</p>

<p>The comitia tributa under tribunician presidency had at
length become an effective constitutional factor in legislation
and in jurisdiction. But its action in the former sphere was
dependent upon the favor of the senate, in the latter on that of
a patrician magistrate. The range, too, of its legislation was
restricted by the wide administrative powers of the senate. We
shall find it in the following period winning freedom and enlarging
the field of its activity.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE COMITIA TRIBUTA AND THE RISE OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY<br />
<span class="smcap">From 449 to 287</span></span></h3>

</div>

<p>For a time after the Valerian-Horatian legislation the senate
and magistrates, as was intimated at the close of the preceding
chapter, maintained their authority but slightly impaired against
the rising popular power. It is true that in 427 the centuries
acquired the right to declare a war of aggression.<a id="FNanchor_1695" href="#Footnote_1695" class="fnanchor">[1695]</a> Defensive
wars in behalf either of Rome or of an ally were regularly
decided upon by the senate;<a id="FNanchor_1696" href="#Footnote_1696" class="fnanchor">[1696]</a> and the question whether the
war was necessary for the safety of the state admitted of a
broad interpretation.<a id="FNanchor_1697" href="#Footnote_1697" class="fnanchor">[1697]</a> From the beginning of the period to
the year 321 treaties of peace and of alliance were still made
either by a magistrate, with the authorization of the senate,<a id="FNanchor_1698" href="#Footnote_1698" class="fnanchor">[1698]</a>
or more commonly by the senate itself, even though the
alliance or offer of protection was such as to render war
with other states inevitable;<a id="FNanchor_1699" href="#Footnote_1699" class="fnanchor">[1699]</a> and at the close of a conquest
the senate disposed of the acquired territory and population.<a id="FNanchor_1700" href="#Footnote_1700" class="fnanchor">[1700]</a>
Through its authority alone, till 332, the censor bestowed the
perfect or the limited citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_1701" href="#Footnote_1701" class="fnanchor">[1701]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>In the affairs of peace it retained almost as absolute power
of administration as in the preceding period.<a id="FNanchor_1702" href="#Footnote_1702" class="fnanchor">[1702]</a> We find it,
accordingly, authorizing a magistrate to vow games and the
erection of a temple in the event of victory,<a id="FNanchor_1703" href="#Footnote_1703" class="fnanchor">[1703]</a> providing for
the restoration of the city after the Gallic conflagration,<a id="FNanchor_1704" href="#Footnote_1704" class="fnanchor">[1704]</a> for
the building of temples,<a id="FNanchor_1705" href="#Footnote_1705" class="fnanchor">[1705]</a> introducing pay for military service,<a id="FNanchor_1706" href="#Footnote_1706" class="fnanchor">[1706]</a>
levying the taxes,<a id="FNanchor_1707" href="#Footnote_1707" class="fnanchor">[1707]</a> dividing the public lands among the citizens,<a id="FNanchor_1708" href="#Footnote_1708" class="fnanchor">[1708]</a>
founding colonies,<a id="FNanchor_1709" href="#Footnote_1709" class="fnanchor">[1709]</a> and recalling under penalty of death those
who without permission had gone out to colonize a captured
city,<a id="FNanchor_1710" href="#Footnote_1710" class="fnanchor">[1710]</a> directing the appropriate college to consult the Sibylline
books,<a id="FNanchor_1711" href="#Footnote_1711" class="fnanchor">[1711]</a> and ordering the aediles to take measures against the
inroad of foreign superstitions,<a id="FNanchor_1712" href="#Footnote_1712" class="fnanchor">[1712]</a> and the consuls to punish
with rods and beheading the instigators to revolt among the
allies.<a id="FNanchor_1713" href="#Footnote_1713" class="fnanchor">[1713]</a> It was in obedience to a decree of the senate that the
consul, or military tribune with consular power, suspended his
own imperium and that of his colleague or colleagues by the
appointment of a dictator,<a id="FNanchor_1714" href="#Footnote_1714" class="fnanchor">[1714]</a> who had power to compel the
resignation of all other magistrates.<a id="FNanchor_1715" href="#Footnote_1715" class="fnanchor">[1715]</a> Or the senate could
directly order the magistrates to retire from office, with or
without a scruple as to the auspices.<a id="FNanchor_1716" href="#Footnote_1716" class="fnanchor">[1716]</a> It rewarded successful
commanders with triumphs<a id="FNanchor_1717" href="#Footnote_1717" class="fnanchor">[1717]</a> at the expense of the state<a id="FNanchor_1718" href="#Footnote_1718" class="fnanchor">[1718]</a> and
in time of especial danger it armed the consuls with absolute
imperium.<a id="FNanchor_1719" href="#Footnote_1719" class="fnanchor">[1719]</a> In the face of an opposing force so vast as here
indicated, the assemblies for a time made slow headway. The
development of their functions through the period between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
the Valerian-Horatian and the Hortensian legislation will now
be followed.</p>

<h4>I. <i>Elective</i></h4>

<p>Appreciating the great possibilities of the tribunate, the patricians
attempted to fill the college with men of their own rank.
If we are to trust our authorities, an effort was made in that
direction immediately after the fall of the decemvirs, when
it was agreed that the pontifex maximus should preside over
the tribal comitia for the election of the first tribunes of the
plebs under the restored constitution.<a id="FNanchor_1720" href="#Footnote_1720" class="fnanchor">[1720]</a> Among the men chosen
were some so closely attached to patrician interests that at
the end of the year they secured the election of successors
who coöpted into the college two patricians of consular rank.<a id="FNanchor_1721" href="#Footnote_1721" class="fnanchor">[1721]</a>
At this crisis there was great danger that the college of tribunes
might become a possession of the patricians. It was averted,
however, by a certain tribune, L. Trebonius, who succeeded
in carrying a law that whoever presided over the comitia
for the election of tribunes should continue till ten tribunes
were elected, the object being to preclude coöptation. The
tribune who violated this law was to be burned alive.<a id="FNanchor_1722" href="#Footnote_1722" class="fnanchor">[1722]</a> That
part of Livy’s account which assigns the author of the law
to the year 448 is improbable. A half century later (401)
he informs us, it happened that two places left vacant in
the college were again filled by the coöptation of patricians
and, by the strangest accident, a Cn. Trebonius was among
their colleagues. His complaint that the Trebonian plebiscite
and the leges sacratae were being violated had, in Livy’s
opinion,<a id="FNanchor_1723" href="#Footnote_1723" class="fnanchor">[1723]</a> no result. Probability greatly favors the later date
for the law, especially as an instance of coöptation is mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
between the two dates;<a id="FNanchor_1724" href="#Footnote_1724" class="fnanchor">[1724]</a> the name of Trebonius or of
one or more patricians in the college of 448<a id="FNanchor_1725" href="#Footnote_1725" class="fnanchor">[1725]</a> was enough to
lead the historian astray. The later date fits well the political
condition of the time; the patricians, almost succeeding in
monopolizing the military tribunate with consular power, proceeded
to lay hands on the plebeian tribunate—a far more
valuable prize. After 401, however, the Trebonian law proved
effective in excluding patricians from the tribunate of the
plebs. Henceforth all plebeian officials were elected by the
tribes under tribunician presidency.<a id="FNanchor_1726" href="#Footnote_1726" class="fnanchor">[1726]</a></p>

<p>In granting the tribal assembly a share in law-making the senate
must have hoped to convert it into an organ of the patrician
government. Shortly after the Valerian-Horatian legislation,
accordingly, patrician magistrates began to convoke this assembly
for the election of quaestors (447)—previously appointed
by the chief magistrates<a id="FNanchor_1727" href="#Footnote_1727" class="fnanchor">[1727]</a>—and afterward of curule
aediles (367),<a id="FNanchor_1728" href="#Footnote_1728" class="fnanchor">[1728]</a> military tribunes,<a id="FNanchor_1729" href="#Footnote_1729" class="fnanchor">[1729]</a> and other minor officials.<a id="FNanchor_1730" href="#Footnote_1730" class="fnanchor">[1730]</a></p>

<h4>II. <i>Judicial</i></h4>

<h5><i>a.</i> TRIBUNICIAN</h5>

<p>By an arrangement referred to in the preceding chapter,<a id="FNanchor_1731" href="#Footnote_1731" class="fnanchor">[1731]</a>
partly based on the law of the Twelve Tables relating to capital
cases<a id="FNanchor_1732" href="#Footnote_1732" class="fnanchor">[1732]</a> and further developed in 449, possibly by an article of
the Valerian-Horatian statute, a division of popular jurisdiction
was made between the centuriate and the tribal assemblies, on
the basis of a distinction in the nature, not of the crime, but of
the penalty.<a id="FNanchor_1733" href="#Footnote_1733" class="fnanchor">[1733]</a> The tribes punished with fines, the centuries
with the extreme penalty—banishment or death, to which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
always added total confiscation of property. The prosecutor,
accordingly, first thought of the penalty, to which he then attempted
to adapt the form of action. The people were not
guided to their decision by legal formalities and precedents,<a id="FNanchor_1734" href="#Footnote_1734" class="fnanchor">[1734]</a>
but were often swayed by the emotions of favor and anger.<a id="FNanchor_1735" href="#Footnote_1735" class="fnanchor">[1735]</a>
No juror’s oath was imposed upon them to decide according to
law and without personal or party bias, such as the Athenian
heliasts swore. If the prosecutor, in addition to believing that
the case merited the severest punishment, hoped to persuade
the people to vote the death or banishment of the accused, he
pronounced a capital condemnation, and the case was accordingly
appealed to the centuriate assembly. If on the other
hand he doubted whether he would be able sufficiently to excite
the anger of the populace against the accused, however heinous
the crime may have been in his own opinion, he satisfied himself
with a finable action, and allowed it to go before the tribes.
Sometimes while the evidence was being taken in the latter
form of action, the rage of the people was so inflamed against
the accused that they clamored for the extreme penalty, in
which case the prosecutor might change the form of action
agreeably to their wishes.<a id="FNanchor_1736" href="#Footnote_1736" class="fnanchor">[1736]</a> The greater ease with which the
tribes were summoned, together with the growing disinclination
of the people to pronouncing the death penalty, induced the
magistrates more and more to make use of finable rather than
of capital actions. Fines were generally estimated in cattle
and sheep till in 430 the consuls L. Julius and L. Papirius Crassus
passed a centuriate law establishing a hundred pounds of
copper as equivalent to an ox and ten to a sheep.<a id="FNanchor_1737" href="#Footnote_1737" class="fnanchor">[1737]</a> Probably
the same law provided that no fine should exceed half the value
of the estate on which it was levied.<a id="FNanchor_1738" href="#Footnote_1738" class="fnanchor">[1738]</a></p>

<p>For the period immediately following 449 the authorities—uncritically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
as will soon be made evident—assign to the tribunes
of the plebs a formidable jurisdiction in finable actions,
not only over private persons,<a id="FNanchor_1739" href="#Footnote_1739" class="fnanchor">[1739]</a> but also, on account of official
misconduct, over functionaries of every grade from ambassadors
and tresviri coloniae deducendae to consuls and dictators.
Such prosecutions were usually brought after the retirement of
the accused from office. A chronological list of the principal
cases reported will be instructive.</p>

<p>In 442 the three commissioners for conducting a colony to
Ardea were prosecuted by the tribunes on the ground that, by
enrolling Ardeates in place of Romans in the list of colonists,
they had circumvented the law which called their commission
into being. The action would probably have been finable; but
the accused avoided trial by remaining in the colony.<a id="FNanchor_1740" href="#Footnote_1740" class="fnanchor">[1740]</a> In 423
M. Postumius and T. Quinctius, retired tribunes with consular
power, were tried for mismanagement of the war with Veii. The
former was fined 10,000 asses; the latter was exculpated by all
the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1741" href="#Footnote_1741" class="fnanchor">[1741]</a> In 401 two other retired tribunes with consular
power were prosecuted by the tribunes of the plebs and fined
each 10,000 asses.<a id="FNanchor_1742" href="#Footnote_1742" class="fnanchor">[1742]</a> The imposition of a fine on Camillus, 391,
has already been considered.<a id="FNanchor_1743" href="#Footnote_1743" class="fnanchor">[1743]</a> In 389 a tribune of the plebs
brought an accusation against Q. Fabius on the ground that the
latter while ambassador to the Gauls had fought against them
in violation of the law of nations. The accused suddenly died,
possibly by suicide, before the day of trial.<a id="FNanchor_1744" href="#Footnote_1744" class="fnanchor">[1744]</a> In 362 the dictator
of the preceding year, L. Manlius, was prosecuted by a
tribune because, though appointed for the sole purpose of driving
the nail, he had nevertheless made a levy of troops and
that with extreme cruelty. But the prosecutor dropped the accusation,
intimidated by the son of the accused.<a id="FNanchor_1745" href="#Footnote_1745" class="fnanchor">[1745]</a> This is the
view of Livy, whereas Cicero<a id="FNanchor_1746" href="#Footnote_1746" class="fnanchor">[1746]</a> states the ground of the charge
to have been the addition of a few days to his dictatorship. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
historical, the prosecution may possibly have been for perduellio,
and in that case it would have come before the centuries.</p>

<p>The following cases are historically more certain. Lucius
Postumius, prosecuted by the tribunes of the plebs in 293 for
the misuse of his consulship of the preceding year, escaped
trial by becoming the legatus of the consul Carvilius. The
charge was that in his campaign he had not limited himself to
the province assigned him by the senate.<a id="FNanchor_1747" href="#Footnote_1747" class="fnanchor">[1747]</a> Evidently the intention
of the prosecutor was not serious.<a id="FNanchor_1748" href="#Footnote_1748" class="fnanchor">[1748]</a> The consul Q.
Fabius Gurges of the year 292, defeated in battle, was recalled,
and his conduct was impugned before the people. The past
services and the promises of his father saved him, and he continued
his consulship with greater success. The accusation
probably did not take the form of a trial, but was presented
in a resolution to remove him from office<a id="FNanchor_1749" href="#Footnote_1749" class="fnanchor">[1749]</a> or at least from the
command of the army. L. Postumius, third time consul in 291,
employed his army to work on his own estate; and on the
expiration of his office he was brought to trial therefor by the
tribunes and condemned.<a id="FNanchor_1750" href="#Footnote_1750" class="fnanchor">[1750]</a></p>

<p>In the period under discussion, 449-287, a single effort to
hold the plebeian tribunes responsible for their official conduct
is reported. In 293 two retired tribunes were condemned to a
fine of 10,000 asses each on a charge of having favored the
patres by interceding against the proposals of colleagues.<a id="FNanchor_1751" href="#Footnote_1751" class="fnanchor">[1751]</a>
This instance, if historical, is the only one of the kind before
the revolution. The tribunes doubtless felt that the prosecution
of their predecessors rendered their own future unsafe.</p>

<p>Several attempts were also made by legislation to reach
results equivalent to judicial sentences. In spite of the prohibition
of privilegia by a law of the Twelve Tables, Sp. Maelius,
a tribune of the plebs in 436, tried to carry a resolution
for the confiscation of the property of Servilius Ahala; but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
people rejected it.<a id="FNanchor_1752" href="#Footnote_1752" class="fnanchor">[1752]</a> Another privilegium was the resolution of
the plebs of 368 which threatened M. Furius Camillus with a
fine of 500,000 asses, should he use his dictatorship to obstruct
the Licinian-Sextian bills then under discussion.<a id="FNanchor_1753" href="#Footnote_1753" class="fnanchor">[1753]</a> It was
certainly not supported by a senatus consultum, and probably
the proposers had no serious intention of carrying it into
effect.</p>

<p>In reviewing the finable actions alleged to have been brought
by the plebeian tribunes during the two centuries which intervened
between the institution of their office and the Hortensian
legislation, as in the case of the capital actions,<a id="FNanchor_1754" href="#Footnote_1754" class="fnanchor">[1754]</a> we are struck
by the relatively small number belonging to the latter part of the
period; in fact to the time following 362 two cases only are
assigned, one of which is insignificant. The conclusion we must
draw from this fact is similar to that expressed with relation
to the capital cases—that the finable actions attributed to the
earlier period are in all probability largely unhistorical, and
that before the enactment of the Hortensian law the jurisdiction
of the tribunes in finable cases was limited and rare.</p>

<h5><i>b.</i> AEDILICIAN</h5>

<p>For some time after their institution the tribunes of the
plebs, having no viatores or at least none that were recognized
as public officials,<a id="FNanchor_1755" href="#Footnote_1755" class="fnanchor">[1755]</a> depended upon the two plebeian aediles as
bailiffs for making arrests and for executing sentences.<a id="FNanchor_1756" href="#Footnote_1756" class="fnanchor">[1756]</a> The
latter functionaries seem to have stood in some such relation
to the tribunes as the quaestors toward the consuls. It was
accordingly as deputies of the tribunes that they acquired
jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_1757" href="#Footnote_1757" class="fnanchor">[1757]</a> The earliest mentioned case, 454, is the trial
and condemnation of a retired consul in a finable action for
official misconduct.<a id="FNanchor_1758" href="#Footnote_1758" class="fnanchor">[1758]</a> It should be placed in the same mythical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
category with the numerous tribunician prosecutions of
the period.<a id="FNanchor_1759" href="#Footnote_1759" class="fnanchor">[1759]</a> After the institution of curule aediles, 367, the
aediles of the plebs continued indeed to serve occasionally as
bailiffs of the tribunes,<a id="FNanchor_1760" href="#Footnote_1760" class="fnanchor">[1760]</a> but acquired in addition, along with those
of curule rank, an independent jurisdiction. In 357 C. Licinius
Stolo was prosecuted by M. Popillius Laenas on the charge of
having circumvented his own law by emancipating his son in
order that he and his son might each possess five hundred iugera
of the public land. He was fined 10,000 asses.<a id="FNanchor_1761" href="#Footnote_1761" class="fnanchor">[1761]</a> From the cases
to be mentioned below the inference may be drawn that the
accuser was an aedile. In 298 several persons were prosecuted
by the aediles, whether curule or plebeian is not stated, for
violation of the same law, and hardly one was acquitted.<a id="FNanchor_1762" href="#Footnote_1762" class="fnanchor">[1762]</a> In
295 the plebeian aediles made considerable money by fining
those who had trespassed against the article of the Licinian-Sextian
statute which related to pasturage;<a id="FNanchor_1763" href="#Footnote_1763" class="fnanchor">[1763]</a> and two years
afterward violators of the same provision were again fined, on
this occasion by the curule aediles.<a id="FNanchor_1764" href="#Footnote_1764" class="fnanchor">[1764]</a> Actions against usurers
were brought by aediles in 344,<a id="FNanchor_1765" href="#Footnote_1765" class="fnanchor">[1765]</a> 304,<a id="FNanchor_1766" href="#Footnote_1766" class="fnanchor">[1766]</a> and 295.<a id="FNanchor_1767" href="#Footnote_1767" class="fnanchor">[1767]</a></p>

<p>Shortly before 328, M. Flavius was prosecuted before the
people by the aediles for the crimen stupratae matris familiae,
and acquitted.<a id="FNanchor_1768" href="#Footnote_1768" class="fnanchor">[1768]</a> In 295 Q. Fabius Gurges, a curule aedile,<a id="FNanchor_1769" href="#Footnote_1769" class="fnanchor">[1769]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
accused several matrons before the people, also of stuprum, and
fined them.</p>

<p>In the period between the Licinian-Sextian and the Hortensian
legislation, accordingly, the jurisdiction of the aediles, so
far as is known, was limited to usury, stuprum, and the violation
of laws regarding the occupation and pasturage of the public
land. They had nothing to do with perduellio or related
offences, or with the accountability of magistrates, or with any
capital actions whatsoever. All their trials were finable, and in
case the fine exceeded thirty cattle and two sheep, or the equivalent,
3020 heavy asses,<a id="FNanchor_1770" href="#Footnote_1770" class="fnanchor">[1770]</a> an appeal could be made to the tribes.
The plebeian aediles equally with the tribunes<a id="FNanchor_1771" href="#Footnote_1771" class="fnanchor">[1771]</a> lacked the
power to summon patricians, whereas the curule aediles as
patrician magistrates<a id="FNanchor_1772" href="#Footnote_1772" class="fnanchor">[1772]</a> possessed the right; but no distinction
in the composition of these tribal assemblies, corresponding to
the form of presidency, is suggested by the sources.<a id="FNanchor_1773" href="#Footnote_1773" class="fnanchor">[1773]</a></p>

<h4>III. <i>Legislative</i></h4>

<p>The legislative function of the tribal assembly under tribunician
presidency after the decemvirate (451-450)<a id="FNanchor_1774" href="#Footnote_1774" class="fnanchor">[1774]</a> is represented
as bringing forthwith into being the Icilian and Duillian plebiscites
of 449. That of Icilius granted amnesty to those who had
seceded from the decemvirs.<a id="FNanchor_1775" href="#Footnote_1775" class="fnanchor">[1775]</a> The first plebiscite of Duillius
provided for the election of consuls cum provocatione.<a id="FNanchor_1776" href="#Footnote_1776" class="fnanchor">[1776]</a> Both
acts are alleged to have been passed, however, before the resolutions
of the plebs had acquired the force of law. The second
Duillian plebiscite, which followed the enactment of the Valerian-Horatian
statute, and which was therefore valid for all the
citizens, threatened with scourging and death any one who left
the plebs without tribunes or who caused the election of a magistrate
without appeal.<a id="FNanchor_1777" href="#Footnote_1777" class="fnanchor">[1777]</a> Its first provision was merely the expression
of a principle on which the plebeians, had from the
beginning insisted as essential to the continuance of the office
from year to year;<a id="FNanchor_1778" href="#Footnote_1778" class="fnanchor">[1778]</a> the second clause precluded the recurrence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
of an elective magistracy like the decemvirate just past.<a id="FNanchor_1779" href="#Footnote_1779" class="fnanchor">[1779]</a> According
to Diodorus<a id="FNanchor_1780" href="#Footnote_1780" class="fnanchor">[1780]</a> an agreement was made in this year between
the patricians and plebeians by which one consul at least
should be a plebeian. Although Diodorus generally drew from
sources more ancient than those of Livy, he is wrong in assigning
this provision to so early a date.<a id="FNanchor_1781" href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor">[1781]</a></p>

<p>For the same year is recorded another Icilian plebiscite, which
granted the privilege of a triumph to the consuls after the senate
had refused it.<a id="FNanchor_1782" href="#Footnote_1782" class="fnanchor">[1782]</a> The alleged act is suspicious, in the first
place, because the two consuls must have had the support of a
majority in the senate, as the acceptance of their great constitutional
statute proves. Then, too, a resolution of the people for
granting the triumph could not avail in this period without the
consent of the senate. The last observation applies as well to
the alleged refusal of the senate to ratify an act of the people
in 356 for granting a triumph to the first plebeian dictator.<a id="FNanchor_1783" href="#Footnote_1783" class="fnanchor">[1783]</a>
Such a resolution merely assured the triumphator that the
people would be present at the festival. Without the consent
of the senate, they could not appropriate the necessary funds
for the occasion;<a id="FNanchor_1784" href="#Footnote_1784" class="fnanchor">[1784]</a> but the general always had a right to triumph,
in earlier time within the city and later on the Alban
Mount, at his own expense.<a id="FNanchor_1785" href="#Footnote_1785" class="fnanchor">[1785]</a> If the senate decreed the triumph,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
as remained the rule,<a id="FNanchor_1786" href="#Footnote_1786" class="fnanchor">[1786]</a> ratification by the people was unnecessary,
though it sometimes occurred.<a id="FNanchor_1787" href="#Footnote_1787" class="fnanchor">[1787]</a></p>

<p>The Trebonian plebiscite, 448 or more probably 401, has
already been discussed.<a id="FNanchor_1788" href="#Footnote_1788" class="fnanchor">[1788]</a> The interest of the plebs in enhancing
the dignity and importance of their own order manifested
itself not only in this act but also in the Canuleian plebiscite of
445, which reëstablished conubium between the patricians and
plebeians after it had been forbidden by a law of the Twelve
Tables.<a id="FNanchor_1789" href="#Footnote_1789" class="fnanchor">[1789]</a> Closely related is the centuriate law of the same year
for the institution of tribunes of the soldiers with consular
power to be elected indiscriminately from the two social classes.<a id="FNanchor_1790" href="#Footnote_1790" class="fnanchor">[1790]</a></p>

<p>Slightly earlier, if we may trust our sources, the people were
given an unwonted opportunity to share in the decision of
questions relating to foreign affairs; and the favor fell to the
comitia tributa under patrician presidency, which had convened
in this form for the first time in 447 for the election of quaestors.<a id="FNanchor_1791" href="#Footnote_1791" class="fnanchor">[1791]</a>
The question before this assembly in 446 was the arbitration
of a dispute between Ardea and Aricia concerning a
piece of territory. The contestants brought the case before the
Roman senate, which usually decided such matters on its own
responsibility, but which in this instance requested the consuls
to refer the business to the tribes. The aim of the senate must
have been to throw the odium of the decision upon the people,
who, disregarding the claims of the two contestants, lost little
time in adjudging the disputed property to Rome.<a id="FNanchor_1792" href="#Footnote_1792" class="fnanchor">[1792]</a> This act
did not serve as a precedent for further interference of the assembly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
in foreign affairs; and when in 427 the people acquired
the right to declare an offensive war,<a id="FNanchor_1793" href="#Footnote_1793" class="fnanchor">[1793]</a> the function fell to the
centuries rather than to the tribes. Apart from this gain the
comitia made little progress<a id="FNanchor_1794" href="#Footnote_1794" class="fnanchor">[1794]</a> in the period between the Canuleian
and the Licinian-Sextian legislation, 445-367. Few legislative
acts of the tribes are recorded: the plebiscite which provided
in a time of famine for the election of a prefect of the
market, 440;<a id="FNanchor_1795" href="#Footnote_1795" class="fnanchor">[1795]</a> the historically questionable plebiscite which
forbade candidates for office to whiten their garments, 432;<a id="FNanchor_1796" href="#Footnote_1796" class="fnanchor">[1796]</a>
the plebiscite of 414 for the creation of a special court to try a
case of murder;<a id="FNanchor_1797" href="#Footnote_1797" class="fnanchor">[1797]</a> the act, probably a plebiscite, which forbade
a patrician to dwell on the Capitoline, 384.<a id="FNanchor_1798" href="#Footnote_1798" class="fnanchor">[1798]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless in this period there was much agrarian agitation
on the part of the tribunes, although we cannot be sure that any
of the bills mentioned by Livy<a id="FNanchor_1799" href="#Footnote_1799" class="fnanchor">[1799]</a> are historical. In like manner
the leaders of the plebs, as candidates for the consular tribunate,
are represented as agitating for the institution of pay for
military service, the money to be derived from rents of public
lands.<a id="FNanchor_1800" href="#Footnote_1800" class="fnanchor">[1800]</a> When the reform came, however, it was by a voluntary
concession of the senate extremely annoying to the tribunes,
who found themselves thus deprived of a useful ground for
complaint, 406.<a id="FNanchor_1801" href="#Footnote_1801" class="fnanchor">[1801]</a> Epoch-making were the Licinian-Sextian laws,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
the first, 368, increasing the duoviri sacris faciundis to decemviri
and providing that five should be plebeian,<a id="FNanchor_1802" href="#Footnote_1802" class="fnanchor">[1802]</a> the second, 367,
containing in Livy’s opinion four articles: (1) that one consul
must be plebeian,<a id="FNanchor_1803" href="#Footnote_1803" class="fnanchor">[1803]</a> (2) that the interest already paid on debts
should be deducted from the principal and the balance rendered
in three equal annual instalments, (3) that no one should occupy
more than five hundred iugera of the public land,<a id="FNanchor_1804" href="#Footnote_1804" class="fnanchor">[1804]</a> (4) that the
right to pasture cattle and sheep on the public land should also
be limited.<a id="FNanchor_1805" href="#Footnote_1805" class="fnanchor">[1805]</a></p>

<p>Thereafter we find the tribal assembly more active in legislation.
To the year 358 is assigned the first well-authenticated
lex de ambitu, the Poetelian plebiscite, which forbade candidates
for office to visit markets and meeting-places outside the city
for electioneering purposes.<a id="FNanchor_1806" href="#Footnote_1806" class="fnanchor">[1806]</a> The motive, however, which Livy
attributes to the author—to prevent the further enlargement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
of the patricio-plebeian nobility through the admission of new
men—was hardly possible at this early date.</p>

<p>In 357 tribal comitia under patrician chairmanship passed a
law for placing a tax of five per cent on manumissions of slaves.
The circumstances attending this meeting were peculiar; the
consul Cn. Manlius summoned to it the soldiers of his army in
the camp at Sutrium.<a id="FNanchor_1807" href="#Footnote_1807" class="fnanchor">[1807]</a> It must have been composed, therefore,
of a small minority of the citizens, lacking not only those who
were too old for service, but doubtless a majority of the men
of military age. Difficulties regarding the auspices, too, and
other formalities might have arisen; and yet in spite of the fact
that the enactment of the law was an intrusion within the
administrative domain of the senate, the patres gave their sanction;<a id="FNanchor_1808" href="#Footnote_1808" class="fnanchor">[1808]</a>
and the legality of the measure was never called in
question.<a id="FNanchor_1809" href="#Footnote_1809" class="fnanchor">[1809]</a> In contrast with the general prevalence of free
labor in early Rome, the number of slaves since the conquest
of Veii had become considerable; and wealthy individuals were
evidently beginning the practice of building up a political following
through the clientage of their freedmen, to the disadvantage
of the older plebs. The majority of the patricians must
have been in sympathy with the effort of their consul to check
this new development, although they could not approve the
peculiar means by which the law was passed. Nor could the
tribunes of the plebs allow legislation to be thus removed
beyond the sphere of their control. The repetition of the
procedure was immediately forbidden accordingly by a plebiscite
which threatened with the death penalty any magistrate
who held comitia away from the city.<a id="FNanchor_1810" href="#Footnote_1810" class="fnanchor">[1810]</a> In the same year the
people took a further step in the administration of finance by
enacting the Duillian-Menenian plebiscite for establishing the
rate of interest at ten per cent<a id="FNanchor_1811" href="#Footnote_1811" class="fnanchor">[1811]</a>—thereby confirming a law of
the Twelve Tables<a id="FNanchor_1812" href="#Footnote_1812" class="fnanchor">[1812]</a>—and five years later the consular law of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
P. Valerius Publicola and C. Marcius Rutilus for the institution
of a bank under the direction of five commissioners to assist
debtors in meeting their obligations (352).<a id="FNanchor_1813" href="#Footnote_1813" class="fnanchor">[1813]</a> The latter was
followed in 347 by a plebiscite which reduced the maximal rate
of interest to five per cent and provided for the payment of the
principal in four equal annual instalments.<a id="FNanchor_1814" href="#Footnote_1814" class="fnanchor">[1814]</a></p>

<p>This activity of the people in financial legislation is to be
explained by the economic distress which lasted many years,
and which the measures thus far mentioned failed to remedy.
There can be no doubt that the general indebtedness and the
resultant discontent of the masses, assigned by the annalists to
the earliest years of the republic, belong in reality to the period
now under consideration. The murmurings of the debtors culminated
in 342 in a military mutiny, with which the masses of
citizens seem to have been in full sympathy. The demands of
the soldiers and civilians were met (1) by a law of the dictator
Valerius, which, remedying other grievances of the soldiers, is
said to have proclaimed an abolition of debts,<a id="FNanchor_1815" href="#Footnote_1815" class="fnanchor">[1815]</a> (2) by the plebiscite
of L. Genucius, tribune of the same year. The provisions
of the latter were as follows: (1) it forbade the lending of
money on interest; (2) it ordered that no one should fill the
same office within a period of ten years, or two offices at the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
time;(3) it allowed both consuls to be plebeian.<a id="FNanchor_1816" href="#Footnote_1816" class="fnanchor">[1816]</a> Although
Livy, failing to find the Genucian law in all his sources, hesitates
to accept it as historical, there seems to be no cogent ground
for disbelieving that such a statute was actually passed.<a id="FNanchor_1817" href="#Footnote_1817" class="fnanchor">[1817]</a> The
legal rate of interest had recently been lowered one-half; and
the plebeians, not satisfied with the temporary relief afforded
by the cancellation of debts, hoped for all time to free themselves
from an intolerable affliction by one sweeping legislative
act. This article of the plebiscite, however, probably remained
from the beginning a dead letter. The second continued unenforced
for many years,<a id="FNanchor_1818" href="#Footnote_1818" class="fnanchor">[1818]</a> whereas the provision regarding two
consuls had to wait more than a century for its first practical
application.<a id="FNanchor_1819" href="#Footnote_1819" class="fnanchor">[1819]</a> The patricians had often violated the Licinian-Sextian
statute by placing two of their number together in the
consulship. Perhaps the third article of the Genucian law was
intended to make them respect the earlier statute by a threat to
exclude them entirely from this office. If this was the object
of Genucius, his means certainly proved effective.<a id="FNanchor_1820" href="#Footnote_1820" class="fnanchor">[1820]</a></p>

<p>Three years later the dictator Publilius Philo passed through
the centuriate assembly the statute (1) that plebi scita should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
binding on all the quirites; (2) that before the voting began the
patres should give their auctoritas to proposals brought before
the comitia centuriata; (3) that one censor at least should be
plebeian (339).<a id="FNanchor_1821" href="#Footnote_1821" class="fnanchor">[1821]</a> All three articles were alike aimed against
the political dominance of the patricians. The second freed
centuriate legislation from their control;<a id="FNanchor_1822" href="#Footnote_1822" class="fnanchor">[1822]</a> the third<a id="FNanchor_1823" href="#Footnote_1823" class="fnanchor">[1823]</a> assured to
the plebeians a just share in the function of determining the
composition of the tribes, hence of the civil and political status
of every Roman. It was not long afterward that the censors
were to be given in addition the function of revising the list of
senators.<a id="FNanchor_1824" href="#Footnote_1824" class="fnanchor">[1824]</a></p>

<p>The first article has substantially the same form as the
corresponding provision of the Valerian-Horatian statute, 449,
and of the Hortensian, 287.<a id="FNanchor_1825" href="#Footnote_1825" class="fnanchor">[1825]</a> All manner of conjectures as to
the relation of these three laws to one another has been offered,
the readiest theory being that the Valerian-Horatian statute
had become obsolete, and required reënactment.<a id="FNanchor_1826" href="#Footnote_1826" class="fnanchor">[1826]</a> The explanation
is proved impossible by the circumstance that important
plebi scita were passed under the Valerian-Horatian provision,
the last being the Genucian. The Valerian-Horatian law could
not have become obsolete in three years. The true explanation
is to be found in the fact, now well known to historians, that
the political ideas and political struggles assigned by our
sources to the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> belong mostly to the fourth.
The setting of the law of Publilius Volero, 471, was inaccurately
transferred to it from the law of Publilius Philo, 339. The
very existence of the latter statute is proof that the patricians
were at that time declaring plebi scita invalid on the ground
that they were passed by only a part of the people—a complaint
recorded against neither the Canuleian nor the Licinian
plebiscite. Hence, as the sources indicate, the patricians were
in the assembly which passed these two measures. We may
legitimately apply to the period from 449 to 339 the story of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
the long but finally successful struggle on the part of the
tribunes to expel the patricians from the comitia tributa under
plebeian chairmanship—a story which the sources assign to
the period ending in 367. The struggle must be accepted as
historical, for there was in later time no motive for creating
it; and as it must have been a matter of tradition rather than
of record, it could not well be placed earlier than the fourth
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> We may suppose that the patricians yielded the
more readily because they at last recognized their inability
simply by their votes to control the tribunician assembly, and
because from the beginning they disliked to submit to the
authority of a plebeian president. Hence their withdrawal from
that form of comitia was in the first instance voluntary. The
assembly, therefore, which adopted the Genucian plebiscite
was de facto, though not de jure, exclusively plebeian. When
accordingly the patricians objected to its validity on the ground
that it was passed by but a part of the people, Publilius Philo,
the most eminent plebeian statesman of his age, carried through
the centuriate assembly the law above mentioned, that the
resolutions of the tribunician assembly as then constituted, of
plebs only, should be valid for all the people. This interpretation
throws light on the otherwise inexplicable circumstance
that the Genucian plebiscite was so indifferently enforced.
The exclusion of the patricians was in line, too, with the
general policy followed by the plebeians against them in the
fourth century: the plebeians shut the patricians out (1) from
the plebeian tribunate, probably 401. (2) from five places in the
college of decemviri sacris faciundis, 368, and from one of
the consular places, 367. (3) by agreement from the two curule
aedileships on alternate years, (4) from one of the censorial
places, 339. (5) from a fixed number of places in the college
of augurs and of pontiffs, 300. It was in accord with this
tendency to convert the earlier privileges of the patricians into
disabilities that a vote of the people excluded them from
those comitia tributa which were presided over by tribunes.
This state of affairs was formulated in the antiquarian and
juristic definitions of populus and plebs, lex and plebi scitum.
The condition, however, seems to have been only transient.
The dwindling of the patriciate in numbers and strength, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
the corresponding growth of a plebeian nobility, which converted
the tribunate and assembly of plebs into most potent organs
of the senatorial government, obliterated distinctions between
patricians and plebeians within the political assemblies, to such
a degree that for the period after the Hortensian legislation no
reference to an exclusively plebeian assembly is made by any
ancient author. Although this article of the Publilian statute
was never formally repealed, we may feel certain that the principle
involved was no longer remembered in the age of Cicero.<a id="FNanchor_1827" href="#Footnote_1827" class="fnanchor">[1827]</a></p>

<p>The Publilian statute of 339 is not known to have provided
for an extension of the field of competence of the tribal assembly;
yet we find the comitia tributa soon afterward attending to
business heretofore managed by the senate or in one or two
instances by the centuries. Although about a hundred years
earlier the centuriate comitia had acquired the right to ratify or
reject declarations of offensive war,<a id="FNanchor_1828" href="#Footnote_1828" class="fnanchor">[1828]</a> we find no record of a
ratification of a treaty of peace by the people before the year
321, in which occurred the disaster at Caudium; and in this
case it was not only the common opinion in Livy’s time, but
also the understanding of Claudius, the historian, that the
treaty made by the consuls, without the sanction of the senate
or the people, was regular and valid<a id="FNanchor_1829" href="#Footnote_1829" class="fnanchor">[1829]</a>—a “foedus summae religionis,”
as Cicero declares.<a id="FNanchor_1830" href="#Footnote_1830" class="fnanchor">[1830]</a> Even Livy, who aims to prove
the procedure defective, admits that the tribunes of the plebs<a id="FNanchor_1831" href="#Footnote_1831" class="fnanchor">[1831]</a>
and Postumius,<a id="FNanchor_1832" href="#Footnote_1832" class="fnanchor">[1832]</a> one of the consuls who made it, looked upon it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
as legitimate. But according to Livy<a id="FNanchor_1833" href="#Footnote_1833" class="fnanchor">[1833]</a> the senate itself declared
the treaty invalid on the ground that it lacked popular confirmation;<a id="FNanchor_1834" href="#Footnote_1834" class="fnanchor">[1834]</a>
and in that body the principle was then enunciated that
nothing which was to bind the people could be sanctioned without
their order<a id="FNanchor_1835" href="#Footnote_1835" class="fnanchor">[1835]</a>—the first recorded expression of the doctrine
of popular sovereignty among the Romans. In this period,
however, the people were never called upon to ratify the acceptance
of a submission or of an alliance on unequal terms. Such
agreements granting Rome the superior right were negotiated,
as in earlier time, by the magistrate or senate or by both in conjunction.<a id="FNanchor_1836" href="#Footnote_1836" class="fnanchor">[1836]</a>
The details, too, of every treaty were still left to the
magistrates and senate, so that to the end of the republic the
senatus consultum continued to be indispensable.<a id="FNanchor_1837" href="#Footnote_1837" class="fnanchor">[1837]</a> But from
the time of the Caudine misfortune, and in consequence of it,
the principle was established that a treaty involving a concession
of even equal rights on the part of Rome required the
sanction of a popular vote. Recorded instances of such ratification
for this period (321-287) are rare.<a id="FNanchor_1838" href="#Footnote_1838" class="fnanchor">[1838]</a> The function fell to
the comitia tributa under patrician or plebeian presidency,
which in its exercise showed more independence<a id="FNanchor_1839" href="#Footnote_1839" class="fnanchor">[1839]</a> than did the
comitia centuriata in the declaration of wars. In this way the
tribal assembly took its place by the side of the centuriate in
international affairs.<a id="FNanchor_1840" href="#Footnote_1840" class="fnanchor">[1840]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span></p>

<p>The absolute power to bestow the citizenship exercised by
the kings<a id="FNanchor_1841" href="#Footnote_1841" class="fnanchor">[1841]</a> would naturally pass undiminished to the consuls,
and thence to the censors on the institution of the latter. It is
in fact the opinion of Lange<a id="FNanchor_1842" href="#Footnote_1842" class="fnanchor">[1842]</a> that these magistrates respectively
exercised full rights in the matter, and that they consulted the
senate in important cases only. At all events the question is
simply as to the relative participation of the magistrates and
the senate in the function. The final settlement of Latium
after the war, involving the bestowal of citizenship, 338, the
senate seems to have attended to alone through a consultum, no
mention being made of the people.<a id="FNanchor_1843" href="#Footnote_1843" class="fnanchor">[1843]</a> In the whole course of
Roman history to 332 there is no record of a grant of citizenship
by popular vote.<a id="FNanchor_1844" href="#Footnote_1844" class="fnanchor">[1844]</a> As the Acerrani were left out of account
by the senatus consultum above mentioned, L. Papirius in 332
through the first recorded pretorian law granted them the civitas
sine suffragio.<a id="FNanchor_1845" href="#Footnote_1845" class="fnanchor">[1845]</a> In opinion of Lange,<a id="FNanchor_1846" href="#Footnote_1846" class="fnanchor">[1846]</a> based upon a statement
of Velleius,<a id="FNanchor_1847" href="#Footnote_1847" class="fnanchor">[1847]</a> the censors of the year, Q. Publilius Philo and Sp.
Postumius, while enrolling the new citizens, probably obtained a
senatus consultum requesting the praetor to bring this subject
before the tribes. That a senatorial decree was essential is
proved by the case of the Privernates mentioned below. We
may well believe that the great plebeian statesman Publilius
gladly embraced the opportunity to make the tribal assembly a
partner in the important function of imparting the rights of the
city. Three years afterward an order of the people, doubtless of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
the tribes, ex auctoritate patrum, granted the citizenship to the
Privernates, 329.<a id="FNanchor_1848" href="#Footnote_1848" class="fnanchor">[1848]</a> By what authority the Hernicans received
the civitas sine suffragio in 306 is not stated.<a id="FNanchor_1849" href="#Footnote_1849" class="fnanchor">[1849]</a> Long after the
Hortensian legislation the principle was established that the
people alone without the authorization of the senate had a right
to bestow the ius suffragii on whomsoever they pleased.<a id="FNanchor_1850" href="#Footnote_1850" class="fnanchor">[1850]</a> Logically
the function should have fallen to the comitia centuriata
as the source of censorial power; but the tribal assembly assumed
it because of its connection with the making of treaties.<a id="FNanchor_1851" href="#Footnote_1851" class="fnanchor">[1851]</a></p>

<p>It was the province of the centuriate assembly to introduce
permanent regulations of existing magistracies and to institute
new ones;<a id="FNanchor_1852" href="#Footnote_1852" class="fnanchor">[1852]</a> but the function was now transferred, silently so
far as we know, to the tribes. Far-reaching in its effect was
the creation of the promagistracy in 327. No prolongation
of an official power is known to have occurred before this
date. The extension of the territory of Rome and of her
military operations was now calling for greater elasticity in
the duration of commands; but in the face of a strong movement
toward popular rights the senate dared not assume the
responsibility of so sweeping an innovation. It placed in the
hands of the tribunes, accordingly, the business of bringing
before the people a rogation for prolonging the imperium of
the consul Q. Publilius Philo to the end of the war with Naples,
instituting by this precedent the promagistracy.<a id="FNanchor_1853" href="#Footnote_1853" class="fnanchor">[1853]</a> Again
in 295 the imperium of the consul Volumnius was prolonged
for a year by a decree of the senate ratified by a plebiscite.<a id="FNanchor_1854" href="#Footnote_1854" class="fnanchor">[1854]</a>
After the custom had been established, however, the senate
ordinarily attended to the prolonging of the imperium, as in
308,<a id="FNanchor_1855" href="#Footnote_1855" class="fnanchor">[1855]</a> in 296,<a id="FNanchor_1856" href="#Footnote_1856" class="fnanchor">[1856]</a> and in 294,<a id="FNanchor_1857" href="#Footnote_1857" class="fnanchor">[1857]</a> consulting the people, as it seems,
only in cases of tribunician opposition.<a id="FNanchor_1858" href="#Footnote_1858" class="fnanchor">[1858]</a> No instance of popular
interference in the assignment of provinces is mentioned
before 295, when a resolution of the comitia tributa, under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
what form of presidency is not stated, granted Etruria to the
patrician Fabius in preference to the plebeian Decius.<a id="FNanchor_1859" href="#Footnote_1859" class="fnanchor">[1859]</a> This
act was an inroad upon the right of the magistrates to divide
the business of their office among themselves by agreement
or lot. In 292 another resolution of the people recalled from
the field the consul Q. Fabius Gurges because of ill-success in
war with the Samnites. The senate was the prime mover in the
matter, but the form of assembly is unknown. The question
concerned either the abrogation of his magistracy or more
probably his transfer to some other activity.<a id="FNanchor_1860" href="#Footnote_1860" class="fnanchor">[1860]</a> Even in the
latter case the act of the people was a remarkable deviation
from their usual modest policy of dealing with officials.</p>

<p>In 318 a law, doubtless tribal, was passed for sending praefecti
iure dicundo to Capua;<a id="FNanchor_1861" href="#Footnote_1861" class="fnanchor">[1861]</a> and similar laws were from
time to time enacted for assigning the same kind of officials to
other communities of Italy.<a id="FNanchor_1862" href="#Footnote_1862" class="fnanchor">[1862]</a> These prefects continued to
be appointed by the urban praetor till after 124.<a id="FNanchor_1863" href="#Footnote_1863" class="fnanchor">[1863]</a> Whether
the law of 318 was pretorian or tribunician cannot be determined.<a id="FNanchor_1864" href="#Footnote_1864" class="fnanchor">[1864]</a>
Similar in character was the Atilian-Marcian plebiscite
for the election of sixteen military tribunes instead of six,
311.<a id="FNanchor_1865" href="#Footnote_1865" class="fnanchor">[1865]</a> The substitution of election for appointment was in
effect the institution of a magistracy—in this case merely an
increase in number within a magisterial college which had
existed since 362. In the act of 311 the tribes usurped a
function which had hitherto belonged to the centuries.<a id="FNanchor_1866" href="#Footnote_1866" class="fnanchor">[1866]</a>
Although the elective military tribunes remained subordinate
to the consuls, the change increased their dignity and
in some degree their independence, while it tended to impair
the efficiency of the service. Naturally the office became
a stepping-stone to political honors. The Decian plebiscite
of the same year instituted the duumviri navales charged
with the function of repairing, equipping, and commanding the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
fleet.<a id="FNanchor_1867" href="#Footnote_1867" class="fnanchor">[1867]</a> The two plebiscites of this year have the appearance
of a compromise between continental and commercial interests
under the influence of Appius Claudius Caecus the censor.
Closely related is the article of the Ogulnian plebiscite, 300,
which provided for an increase in the number of augurs and
pontiffs.<a id="FNanchor_1868" href="#Footnote_1868" class="fnanchor">[1868]</a> Here, too, belongs the plebiscite of 296 for the appointment
of commissioners for conducting colonies.<a id="FNanchor_1869" href="#Footnote_1869" class="fnanchor">[1869]</a> Henceforth
it was the custom of the senate to refer to the people the
creation of all extraordinary offices, and their election to the
comitia tributa usually under pretorian presidency.<a id="FNanchor_1870" href="#Footnote_1870" class="fnanchor">[1870]</a></p>

<p>The people made a further advance when they undertook
to regulate by law the composition of the senate itself. To
the period between the Publilian legislation of 339 and the censorship
of Appius Claudius Caecus, 312, belongs the famous
Ovinian plebiscite concerning the revision of the senate list.<a id="FNanchor_1871" href="#Footnote_1871" class="fnanchor">[1871]</a>
It transferred the function from the consuls to the censors, and
required the latter under oath (iurati; MS. curiati) to enroll all
who were worthy among the retired magistrates of every rank,
from the curule functionaries down through those of plebeian
standing to the quaestors.<a id="FNanchor_1872" href="#Footnote_1872" class="fnanchor">[1872]</a></p>

<p>The Valerian-Horatian and Publilian statutes are evidence of
the right of the people to legislate regarding the composition
and powers of their assemblies. No longer content, however,
with the making and repeal of laws,—a right guaranteed by the
Twelve Tables,<a id="FNanchor_1873" href="#Footnote_1873" class="fnanchor">[1873]</a>—they began the practice of occasionally suspending
laws to the advantage or disadvantage of individuals or
of classes—in other words, the voting of privilegia.<a id="FNanchor_1874" href="#Footnote_1874" class="fnanchor">[1874]</a> There
were repeated violations of that article of the Genucian plebiscite
which forbade reëlection to an office within a period of ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
years,<a id="FNanchor_1875" href="#Footnote_1875" class="fnanchor">[1875]</a> and no mention is made of the necessity of a dispensation
before the year 298, when Q. Fabius Maximus is alleged
to have objected to further reëlection on the ground that such
conduct was forbidden by law. Thereupon the tribunes of the
plebs declared that to remove the obstacle they would propose
to the people that he should be absolved from the legal requirement.<a id="FNanchor_1876" href="#Footnote_1876" class="fnanchor">[1876]</a>
But in fact, as Lange<a id="FNanchor_1877" href="#Footnote_1877" class="fnanchor">[1877]</a> has noticed, Fabius had not
been consul for ten years and was therefore legally eligible.
Lange suggests that this story of the dispensation may belong
to his next election in 295.<a id="FNanchor_1878" href="#Footnote_1878" class="fnanchor">[1878]</a> At all events the custom of granting
dispensations began about this time,<a id="FNanchor_1879" href="#Footnote_1879" class="fnanchor">[1879]</a> although we need not
suppose that the patricians attached much importance to the
Genucian statute, which was adopted by an exclusively plebeian
assembly. This function assumed by the people of freeing from
the power of the law, often exercised in historical time by the
senate as well, marks a great advance toward popular sovereignty.
The idea that the law was sovereign, which had arisen
in the early republic, was now yielding to the idea that it was
subject to the caprice of every popular gathering.<a id="FNanchor_1880" href="#Footnote_1880" class="fnanchor">[1880]</a> The aristocracy
was giving way to a democracy, which under the conditions
destined to prevail at Rome could only mean mob-rule.</p>

<p>The right of the people in their tribal assemblies to legislate
concerning religion had already been established by the precedent
of the Licinian-Sextian plebiscite on the decemviri sacris
faciundis<a id="FNanchor_1881" href="#Footnote_1881" class="fnanchor">[1881]</a> and of other less important acts.<a id="FNanchor_1882" href="#Footnote_1882" class="fnanchor">[1882]</a> Immediately after
the Publilian legislation the comitia of tribes became more active
in this field. To the period of the great Latin war according
to Cicero,<a id="FNanchor_1883" href="#Footnote_1883" class="fnanchor">[1883]</a> hence necessarily to 338,<a id="FNanchor_1884" href="#Footnote_1884" class="fnanchor">[1884]</a> belongs the consular lex
Maenia, which added to the Ludi Romani the day called
instauraticius,<a id="FNanchor_1885" href="#Footnote_1885" class="fnanchor">[1885]</a> although less trustworthy accounts assign the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
establishment of this day to 491.<a id="FNanchor_1886" href="#Footnote_1886" class="fnanchor">[1886]</a> The law initiated by the
senate in 304 forbidding the dedication of a temple or altar except
by permission of the senate or of a majority of the college
of tribunes<a id="FNanchor_1887" href="#Footnote_1887" class="fnanchor">[1887]</a> was probably passed by the comitia tributa plebis.
In the opinion of Lange<a id="FNanchor_1888" href="#Footnote_1888" class="fnanchor">[1888]</a> it was either identical with, or afterward
supplemented by, the lex Papiria tribunicia, which forbade
the consecration of a temple, precinct, or altar without an order
of the plebs.<a id="FNanchor_1889" href="#Footnote_1889" class="fnanchor">[1889]</a> The latter is the more probable; it seems reasonable
that, as Lange suggests, the right of the people in this
matter developed from the necessity of referring to them cases
in which the senate and the tribunes could not agree. Technically
religious, though of vast political consequence, was the
Ogulnian plebiscite of 300, which increased the number of
augurs and pontiffs to nine each, and provided that four augurs
and five pontiffs should be plebeian.<a id="FNanchor_1890" href="#Footnote_1890" class="fnanchor">[1890]</a> It was the last step in
the opening of offices to the plebs.</p>

<p>In their effort to gain control of the more important judicial
business the people made slower progress. In all probability
it was not till after the Publilian legislation that the centuriate
and tribal assemblies began regularly to exercise the function of
appellate courts—a right established long before by legislation<a id="FNanchor_1891" href="#Footnote_1891" class="fnanchor">[1891]</a>
and confirmed for the centuries by the Valerian law of appeal
in 300.<a id="FNanchor_1892" href="#Footnote_1892" class="fnanchor">[1892]</a> The creation of special judicial commissions—quaestiones
extraordinariae—belonged originally to the senate; and
the establishment of such a court de caede through a plebiscite
in 414, if historical, was merely the execution of a senatus consultum.<a id="FNanchor_1893" href="#Footnote_1893" class="fnanchor">[1893]</a>
The task of trying and condemning the matrons for
poisoning in 331 must have fallen to such a quaestio extraordinaria
not expressly mentioned. Whether it was instituted by
the senate or the tribes cannot be known.<a id="FNanchor_1894" href="#Footnote_1894" class="fnanchor">[1894]</a> The special quaestio,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
too, concerning conspiracy, at first under dictatorial and
afterward under consular presidency, seems to have been instituted
solely by a senatus consultum.<a id="FNanchor_1895" href="#Footnote_1895" class="fnanchor">[1895]</a> The Flavian rogation of
323 for punishing the Tusculans for having given aid and encouragement
to the enemies of Rome<a id="FNanchor_1896" href="#Footnote_1896" class="fnanchor">[1896]</a> may have aimed to create
a special court for the purpose, or it may have been an attempt
to dispense justice by means of legislation.<a id="FNanchor_1897" href="#Footnote_1897" class="fnanchor">[1897]</a> However that may
be, it was rejected by all the tribes but one. The Satricans,
who revolted to the Samnites after the Caudine disaster and
were conquered in 319, were punished by the senate acting as a
special court on the authority of the Antistian plebiscite.<a id="FNanchor_1898" href="#Footnote_1898" class="fnanchor">[1898]</a></p>

<p>The right of the people both in the centuries and in the
tribes to legislate on finance had before 339 been well established
by precedent. Economic as well as social in character
was the lex Poetelia, which prohibited loans on the security
of the person,<a id="FNanchor_1899" href="#Footnote_1899" class="fnanchor">[1899]</a> and which was proposed to the tribes, or possibly
to the centuries, by C. Poetelius Libo as consul in 326 or as
dictator in 313.<a id="FNanchor_1900" href="#Footnote_1900" class="fnanchor">[1900]</a> It abolished contractual but not judicial servitude,
though it probably mitigated the latter.<a id="FNanchor_1901" href="#Footnote_1901" class="fnanchor">[1901]</a> Politically
more significant than this individual act was the long-continued
popular effort to gain control of the disposal of the public
land. It was to the detriment of the senatorial prerogative
that the tribunes of the plebs took up the agrarian question
from the time of Sp. Cassius,<a id="FNanchor_1902" href="#Footnote_1902" class="fnanchor">[1902]</a> and continued almost unceasingly
to agitate for the limitation of the use of public land
by the rich and the division of the surplus among the poor,
till they succeeded in embodying their ideas in the Licinian-Sextian
law on these subjects. Equally to the province of
the senate belonged the planting of colonies<a id="FNanchor_1903" href="#Footnote_1903" class="fnanchor">[1903]</a> both from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
military and from the financial point of view. Here, too, the
tribunes in the economic interest of their constituents began
early to agitate for a share in the administration.<a id="FNanchor_1904" href="#Footnote_1904" class="fnanchor">[1904]</a> It was
not till 296 that they met with any success in this direction,
and then at the will of the senate, which charged the tribunes
with the business of introducing a plebiscite for ordering the
praetor to appoint triumviri for conducting colonies to certain
specified places.<a id="FNanchor_1905" href="#Footnote_1905" class="fnanchor">[1905]</a> This was the modest outcome of centuries
of agrarian and colonial agitation on the part of the tribunes.</p>

<p>The fact is that after the enactment of the Genucian and
Publilian laws the plebeians continued for about a generation
relatively content with their economic condition. Frequent
victories brought booty,<a id="FNanchor_1906" href="#Footnote_1906" class="fnanchor">[1906]</a> and conquests made extensive assignments
of land possible.<a id="FNanchor_1907" href="#Footnote_1907" class="fnanchor">[1907]</a> But the people must have found
the third Samnite war oppressive. Although of far shorter
duration than the second, it required larger armies and longer
and more distant campaigns. Under the burden of military
service the plebs again fell into debt, in spite of the unusual
distributions of booty among the soldiers when victorious.<a id="FNanchor_1908" href="#Footnote_1908" class="fnanchor">[1908]</a>
Their burden was rendered the heavier by the circumstance
that many of the wealthy were violating the Licinian-Sextian
restrictions on the use of public land and pasture, and were
doubtless failing to pay their dues<a id="FNanchor_1909" href="#Footnote_1909" class="fnanchor">[1909]</a>—a course of conduct which
rendered necessary not only the assignment of the spoil of 293
to the aerarium but also the imposition of a tributum especially
vexatious to the plebs.<a id="FNanchor_1910" href="#Footnote_1910" class="fnanchor">[1910]</a> The distress was augmented by a
pestilence which began in 295 and continued for several years.<a id="FNanchor_1911" href="#Footnote_1911" class="fnanchor">[1911]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
Whereas all on actual service were by law exempt from prosecution
for debt, many citizens who remained at home
were the victims of the usurers, who were occasionally fined
for their illegal exactions.<a id="FNanchor_1912" href="#Footnote_1912" class="fnanchor">[1912]</a> Again all the commons incurred
hopeless debts, which at the close of the war (290)
the creditors must have proceeded to exact with their usual
ruthlessness. The institution of the tresviri capitales in the
following year<a id="FNanchor_1913" href="#Footnote_1913" class="fnanchor">[1913]</a> is proof of the intention of the government
to enforce the criminal law with the utmost rigor. A new
movement for the relief of debtors had already set in, and the
creditors were organizing resistance to the popular demands.
As long as the nobility could rely upon the tribunate of the
plebs,<a id="FNanchor_1914" href="#Footnote_1914" class="fnanchor">[1914]</a> they felt secure. Even if a bill for the benefit of
the poor should be presented, they believed their interests
to be well fortified by tribunician intercession and by the
senate, which, composed chiefly of creditors, would certainly
refuse its sanction to such a measure. The grave economic
distress, however, at length filled the tribunate with men who
were at one in demanding a radical measure of relief, and
who accordingly presented a bill for the abolition of debts.
Many times they offered it to the tribes in vain; the senate
refused its assent; for the creditors, among whom must be
counted a majority of the senators, hoped to recover both
principal and interest. Willing to compromise, the tribunes
then offered the senate, if it should yield, a choice of two
alternatives, neither of which can be deduced with certainty
from the mutilated fragment of Dio Cassius, our authority
for this event. One of them, however, is conjectured to be
that the principal alone should be recovered,<a id="FNanchor_1915" href="#Footnote_1915" class="fnanchor">[1915]</a> in what way
cannot be made out; and the other that the interest already
paid should be deducted from the principal, and the balance
rendered in three equal annual instalments—a repetition of
the Licinian-Sextian provision regarding debts. At first the
debtors were willing to grant this concession through fear of
failing to obtain any degree of relief; but the creditors, now
hoping to recover everything, refused to be conciliated. After
a time both parties shifted their attitude; the creditors expressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
themselves as satisfied to recover the principal merely, while
the debtors would no longer accept either alternative of the
compromise. The sedition, for such the conflict became, continued
interminably; and although the creditors yielded, little
by little, far more than they had intended in the beginning,
the debtors made each concession the basis of a new demand.
They brought the long, serious struggle to a climax by seceding
to the Janiculum, at the very time when the Tarentines were
completing the organization of a coalition of Etruscans, Gauls,
Samnites, and several other peoples against Rome.<a id="FNanchor_1916" href="#Footnote_1916" class="fnanchor">[1916]</a> Q. Hortensius,
appointed dictator to meet this crisis, carried through
the comitia centuriata a group of provisions for satisfying the
demands of the seceders:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) Doubtless a clause for the relief of debtors, of which
no mention is made in our scant sources.</p>

<p>(2) A provision that without the consent either of the senate
or of the patrician portion of it a resolution of the plebs
should be valid for all the citizens.<a id="FNanchor_1917" href="#Footnote_1917" class="fnanchor">[1917]</a></p>

<p>At the time when the Valerian-Horatian statute provided that
with the consent of the senate resolutions of the tribunician
comitia tributa should have the force of law, the senate was
still composed exclusively of patricians; and the phrase senatus
consultum in this law was therefore considered a full equivalent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
of the patrum auctoritas, the only difference being that
the consultum was given in advance of a popular vote and the
auctoritas subsequently to it. But when with the appearance
of plebeians in the senate the two acts began to drift more
widely apart, the patricians successfully claimed an exclusive
right to the auctoritas, which, as we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_1918" href="#Footnote_1918" class="fnanchor">[1918]</a> was reduced to
a formality, so far as centuriate legislation was concerned, by
an article of the Publilian law. So long as the patricians voted
in the tribunician comitia tributa, however, and constituted a
majority in the senate, they were willing to abide by the specific
declaration of the Valerian-Horatian statute which conditioned
the validity of the plebiscite on the senatus consultum. But
from 339 they were legally excluded from the tribunician comitia
tributa, and they foresaw, moreover, the end of their majority
in the senate. In the period between 339 and 287, accordingly,
they set up a new claim, based doubtless on the practical intention
of the Valerian-Horatian law, to be free from plebi scita
because the latter were passed without their auctoritas.<a id="FNanchor_1919" href="#Footnote_1919" class="fnanchor">[1919]</a> If
they could make good their intention, they would remain unaffected
by tribunician laws for the abolition of debt. But the
Hortensian statute settled finally the controversy to their disadvantage.
That it also rendered the consultum unessential to
the validity of the plebiscite is proved not only by later usage
but also by the statement of our sources that resolutions of the
plebs were placed by the Hortensian act on an equal footing
with laws.</p>

<p>(3) Now that the tribunes were given equal freedom with the
patrician higher magistrates in initiating legislation, it was of
advantage to the nobility to bring the former into the closest
possible touch with the senate. Probably therefore the right
of the tribunes not only to sit in the senate, but also in the
interest of their business to summon that body and to preside
over its sessions when so convoked, was due to a provision of
the Hortensian law.<a id="FNanchor_1920" href="#Footnote_1920" class="fnanchor">[1920]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span></p>

<p>(4) A correlate of the full power to initiate legislation was
the right to veto acts of the government, probably acquired by
the Hortensian statute.</p>

<p>(5) But the veto depended upon the power to prosecute.<a id="FNanchor_1921" href="#Footnote_1921" class="fnanchor">[1921]</a>
The unlimited veto implied a right to bring finable or capital
actions independently of the will of the patrician magistrates.
Either by a provision of the Hortensian statute or as a direct
consequence of it, the tribunes acquired an unconditioned right
to prosecute, being now competent in capital cases to compel
the praetor to grant the auspices for holding the comitia centuriata.
With the establishment of their absolute power of intercession
and jurisdiction they ceased to resort to sedition.</p>

<p>(6) Another article provided that the market-days should be
fasti, allowing judicial business to be done thereon, but forbade
the meeting of voting assemblies on such days.<a id="FNanchor_1922" href="#Footnote_1922" class="fnanchor">[1922]</a> The peasants
who came into the city to use the markets were thus afforded
an opportunity to have their law suits settled without being
engrossed by the duty of voting, though the magistrates were
at liberty to invite them to informal contiones.<a id="FNanchor_1923" href="#Footnote_1923" class="fnanchor">[1923]</a> This Hortensian
provision was conservative in so far as it placed the tribunician
assembly under the same pontifical regulations of the
calendar as those which were to control the other forms of
comitia.<a id="FNanchor_1924" href="#Footnote_1924" class="fnanchor">[1924]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The right of the people to elect their magistrates, with the
exception of the dictator and the master of horse, existed from
the beginning of the republic. Their right also to create new
offices began with the institution of the consulship, and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
frequently exercised during the period treated in this chapter.
In the age which begins with the Valerian-Horatian legislation
we find the people regulating by law the qualifications and conduct
of candidates as well as the powers and functions of the
magistrates themselves. They had the same right to deal with
the organization and competence of the assemblies. From 358
to 287 they rapidly extended their legislative power, by precedent
rather than by statute, over the whole field of the constitution
and over the administration in all its departments; they
ventured even to regulate the senate and to interfere with the
imperium. Controlled originally by the senate, in the end they
won their freedom from that body, whereas the initiative in every
act always remained with the presiding magistrate. Meantime
they had acquired supreme judicial power. In constitutional
theory they were at last sovereign. The senate and the magistrates,
so this theory asserted, still retained large administrative
powers for the sole reason that the assemblies, unable to manage
the current details of public business, were content with
occasional participation and regulation. Most of these gains
had been made by the tribes under the presidency of tribunes
or of patrician magistrates, usually praetors. In legislation the
comitia tributa had rendered the centuriate assembly dispensable
excepting in declarations of offensive war and in the confirmation
of censorial elections. The question whether the people in
their centuries and tribes were to realize their sovereignty in
actual public life was left to the following period.</p>

</div>

<h4>I. <i>Tribunician Jurisdiction</i></h4>

<p>Whereas the sources assume that the tribunes of the plebs
as early at least as the decemviral legislation had cognizance of
both finable and capital cases,<a id="FNanchor_1925" href="#Footnote_1925" class="fnanchor">[1925]</a> an examination of the recorded
trials leads to the conclusion that they made little use of this
power till the period between the legislation of Publilius Philo
(339) and that of Hortensius (287).<a id="FNanchor_1926" href="#Footnote_1926" class="fnanchor">[1926]</a> Whether their activity
after 339 was due to the Publilian enactment of that year<a id="FNanchor_1927" href="#Footnote_1927" class="fnanchor">[1927]</a> or
merely to the gradual evolution of popular rights cannot be
determined. However that may be, it was not till after the
Hortensian legislation that we find the tribunician jurisdiction
at its highest point of development and free from every
restriction.<a id="FNanchor_1928" href="#Footnote_1928" class="fnanchor">[1928]</a></p>

<p>The capital actions brought by the tribunes before the centuries
in the period from Hortensius to the end of the republic
have already been reviewed.<a id="FNanchor_1929" href="#Footnote_1929" class="fnanchor">[1929]</a> We have now to consider the
finable cases brought before the comitia tributa in the same
period. It is characteristic of the era immediately following
the Hortensian legislation, 287-232, described in the following
chapter as politically stagnant,<a id="FNanchor_1930" href="#Footnote_1930" class="fnanchor">[1930]</a> that only one tribunician prosecution
is mentioned, and that against the consuls of 249 for
contempt of the auspices. Appius Claudius Pulcher, one of
the consuls, was fined a hundred and twenty thousand asses,
after the action had been transferred from the centuries to the
tribes in the way described in an earlier chapter.<a id="FNanchor_1931" href="#Footnote_1931" class="fnanchor">[1931]</a></p>

<p>In accord with the spirit of the Flaminian era, 232-201, on
the other hand, is the prosecution of the retired consuls, M.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
Livius Salinator and L. Aemilius Paulus, on the ground that
they had unjustly distributed the booty gained in war. Technically
the charge seems to have been peculatus;<a id="FNanchor_1932" href="#Footnote_1932" class="fnanchor">[1932]</a> it was
brought before the tribes in 218, doubtless by tribunes of the
plebs. Aemilius narrowly escaped condemnation; Livius was
fined. The popular feeling against them was extremely
bitter.<a id="FNanchor_1933" href="#Footnote_1933" class="fnanchor">[1933]</a> In 214 M. Atilius Regulus and P. Furius Philus,
censors, degraded to the condition of aerarius<a id="FNanchor_1934" href="#Footnote_1934" class="fnanchor">[1934]</a> L. Caecilius
Metellus,<a id="FNanchor_1935" href="#Footnote_1935" class="fnanchor">[1935]</a> who after the battle of Cannae had tried to persuade
the knights to abandon Italy.<a id="FNanchor_1936" href="#Footnote_1936" class="fnanchor">[1936]</a> He was elected tribune of the
plebs for the following year, and made use of his office in an
attempt to prosecute the censors before the close of their administration.
His purpose was thwarted, however, by the
intercession of the remaining nine tribunes,<a id="FNanchor_1937" href="#Footnote_1937" class="fnanchor">[1937]</a> who in this way
saved for a time a conservative principle of the constitution—the
inviolability of the magistrate from prosecutions while in
office.<a id="FNanchor_1938" href="#Footnote_1938" class="fnanchor">[1938]</a> The trial of Postumius the publican, beginning in a
finable action and ending as perduellio, has been treated elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_1939" href="#Footnote_1939" class="fnanchor">[1939]</a>
In the same period falls the trial of the tresviri
nocturni for appearing too late at a fire. They were accused
by the tribunes and condemned by a vote of the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1940" href="#Footnote_1940" class="fnanchor">[1940]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span></p>

<p>The era of the full-grown plutocracy, 201-134, is characterized
by the great number of prosecutions of eminent persons for
political objects. M. Porcius Cato was several times brought
to trial for the conduct of his consulship, 195, with the result
that the speeches delivered in his own defence filled a volume.<a id="FNanchor_1941" href="#Footnote_1941" class="fnanchor">[1941]</a>
In 189 M’. Acilius Glabrio, then candidate for the censorship,
was accused of peculatus of booty by two tribunes in a finable
action of a hundred thousand asses. The crime was alleged
to have been committed in the preceding year, when as proconsul
the accused gained over the Aetolians and Antiochus
a victory by which he won the right to a triumph.<a id="FNanchor_1942" href="#Footnote_1942" class="fnanchor">[1942]</a> Cato,
formerly his military tribune and now a competitor for the
censorship, appearing as a witness, delivered at least four
speeches against him. These proceedings forced Acilius to
drop the candidacy, whereupon the accusation was withdrawn.<a id="FNanchor_1943" href="#Footnote_1943" class="fnanchor">[1943]</a>
The attack upon this man is to be regarded as a manoeuvre of
Cato and his supporters against his political adversaries, the
Scipios, who numbered the accused among their friends. In
185 Cato was ready for a direct assault. In that year two of
his supporters, both named Q. Petillius, tribunes of the plebs,
made in the senate at his instance a demand that L. Scipio
Asiagenus<a id="FNanchor_1944" href="#Footnote_1944" class="fnanchor">[1944]</a> should render an account of the three thousand
talents paid him as war indemnity by Antiochus among the
conditions of peace. His brother Publius, knowing well that
the blow was in reality aimed at himself, resolved to measure
his full strength with that of his adversaries. When accordingly
the record of the transaction was produced, Publius,
complaining that an account of three thousand talents should
be demanded of a man who had brought fifteen thousand into
the treasury from booty, tore the document in pieces.<a id="FNanchor_1945" href="#Footnote_1945" class="fnanchor">[1945]</a> In
this proceeding he kept strictly within his legal rights.<a id="FNanchor_1946" href="#Footnote_1946" class="fnanchor">[1946]</a> Nothing
further seems to have been accomplished for the present;<a id="FNanchor_1947" href="#Footnote_1947" class="fnanchor">[1947]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
but M. Naevius, tribune of the plebs, after entering office
December 10, 185, brought against Publius Scipio a prosecution,
not for peculatus, but for official misconduct. The
specific charge was that in return for the restoration of his
son from captivity he, as legatus of his brother, had granted
too favorable terms of peace to Antiochus. In the first contio
the accused recited his services to the state; in the second,
which happened to fall on the anniversary of his victory over
Hannibal, he invited the people there assembled to go with
him to the Capitoline temple to give thanks to Jupiter, Juno,
Minerva, and the gods who kept the place, for having endowed
him with the will and the ability to achieve that and other
similar deeds in behalf of the commonwealth.<a id="FNanchor_1948" href="#Footnote_1948" class="fnanchor">[1948]</a> Naturally the
dissolution of the assembly vexed the tribunes. Before the
day came for the third contio he withdrew from Rome. His
brother tried to excuse his absence on the plea of sickness, and
Ti. Sempronius Gracchus, tribune of the plebs, prevented his
colleagues from causing further annoyance to the great man.
The general circumstances indicate that the trial was to take
place before the tribes, and that the penalty in case of conviction
was accordingly to be a fine. His brother was still
in danger. Early in 184 C. Minucius Augurinus brought a
finable action<a id="FNanchor_1949" href="#Footnote_1949" class="fnanchor">[1949]</a> against Lucius concerning the money received
from Antiochus.<a id="FNanchor_1950" href="#Footnote_1950" class="fnanchor">[1950]</a> He was condemned by the tribes, whereupon
the prosecutor demanded surety (praedes) for the payment
of the fine. But when Scipio failed to comply, the
tribune attempted to imprison him. Returning suddenly to
Rome, Publius appealed to the tribunes in behalf of his
brother. Whereas eight members of the college sustained the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
prosecutor, one of them, Ti. Gracchus, prevented the imprisonment
and consequently the collection of the fine.<a id="FNanchor_1951" href="#Footnote_1951" class="fnanchor">[1951]</a> But the
total result of the proceedings was the overthrow of the Scipios,
and the conqueror of Hannibal retired heart-broken to his
country estate.<a id="FNanchor_1952" href="#Footnote_1952" class="fnanchor">[1952]</a></p>

<p>In the same year, 184, M. Porcius Cato, at that time censor,
was prosecuted for official misconduct by tribunes in a finable
action for two talents, but was in all probability acquitted.<a id="FNanchor_1953" href="#Footnote_1953" class="fnanchor">[1953]</a> In
this period the tribes must have been unusually active in a
judicial capacity,<a id="FNanchor_1954" href="#Footnote_1954" class="fnanchor">[1954]</a> as Cato was himself prosecuted forty-four
times, often doubtless before the comitia tributa, but was always
given a favorable verdict.<a id="FNanchor_1955" href="#Footnote_1955" class="fnanchor">[1955]</a></p>

<p>C. Lucretius, praetor in 171, was accused in the senate by
Chalcidian ambassadors of merciless cruelties and robberies
perpetrated by him on their community. Thereupon two
tribunes of the plebs, M’. Juventius Thalna and Cn. Aufidius,
prosecuted him before the people, technically on a charge of
furtum and iniuria. He was condemned by all the tribes to a
fine of a million asses.<a id="FNanchor_1956" href="#Footnote_1956" class="fnanchor">[1956]</a> But after 149 most cases of misgovernment
in the provinces came before the quaestio repetundarum
instituted in that year.<a id="FNanchor_1957" href="#Footnote_1957" class="fnanchor">[1957]</a> There were occasional prosecutions for
beginning war without authorization.<a id="FNanchor_1958" href="#Footnote_1958" class="fnanchor">[1958]</a> Toward the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
pre-Gracchan oligarchy C. Laelius Sapiens, the friend of Scipio
Aemilianus, seems to have been brought to trial for malversation
in his consulship of the year 140, but was probably
acquitted.<a id="FNanchor_1959" href="#Footnote_1959" class="fnanchor">[1959]</a> A peculiar case, yet characteristic of the time,
was that against Cn. Tremellius, praetor in 160, for having
“contended injuriously” with the supreme pontiff. It is stated
merely that he was fined. If the action came before the people,
it must have been brought by a tribune, as the pontiff’s jurisdiction
was restricted, so far as is known, to the sacerdotes
under his supervision. Whatever may have been the procedure,
the effect was to place the religious official above the magistrate<a id="FNanchor_1960" href="#Footnote_1960" class="fnanchor">[1960]</a>—a
policy which could be expected of the generation
that adopted the Aelian and Fufian laws.<a id="FNanchor_1961" href="#Footnote_1961" class="fnanchor">[1961]</a></p>

<p>Several prosecutions in the era extending from the Gracchi
to Sulla partake of the revolutionary nature of the time. The
inconsistency in the position of Ti. Gracchus, who depended on
the sanctity of the tribunate while technically violating it in the
person of his colleague Octavius, is illustrated by his attack on
T. Annius Luscus. The latter, a man of consular rank, challenged
Tiberius in the senate to answer definitely whether or not
he had branded with infamy a brother tribune whom the law
declared sacred and inviolable. The senators applauded the
challenge; but Tiberius, hurrying from the Curia, convoked the
plebs, and ordered Annius to come forward and defend himself
against the charge of violating by his words the tribunician
sanctity. Before the proceedings could begin, Annius by permission
asked his accuser: “If you intend to deprive me of
my rank and disgrace me, and I appeal to a colleague of yours,
and he comes to my support, and you thereupon lose your temper,
will you deprive him of his office?” Plutarch, who tells
this story, alleges further that Tiberius, not knowing what to
reply, dismissed the assembly and withdrew his accusation.<a id="FNanchor_1962" href="#Footnote_1962" class="fnanchor">[1962]</a>
But the fact that Annius made a speech against Tiberius<a id="FNanchor_1963" href="#Footnote_1963" class="fnanchor">[1963]</a> indicates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
that the proceedings went farther. Evidently the accused
in some way escaped condemnation. The same political significance
attaches to the tribunician capital prosecutions of the
time, mentioned in an earlier chapter.<a id="FNanchor_1964" href="#Footnote_1964" class="fnanchor">[1964]</a> No more actions, however,
are known to have been brought by the tribunes before
the tribes till 103,<a id="FNanchor_1965" href="#Footnote_1965" class="fnanchor">[1965]</a> when Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, a popular
tribune of the plebs, author of the famous statute concerning the
election of sacerdotes,<a id="FNanchor_1966" href="#Footnote_1966" class="fnanchor">[1966]</a> prosecuted M. Junius Silanus for misconduct
as consul in 109. The charge was that he had begun
war on the Cimbri without an order of the people. Notwithstanding
the stigma of defeat borne by the accused, he was
acquitted by thirty-three of the thirty-five tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1967" href="#Footnote_1967" class="fnanchor">[1967]</a> In the same
year Domitius prosecuted M. Aemilius Scaurus for having as
consul neglected the sacra of the di Penates at Lavinium.
The accused was acquitted by the votes of thirty-two tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1968" href="#Footnote_1968" class="fnanchor">[1968]</a>
These prosecutions, together with the plebiscite just mentioned,
excited against Domitius an antipathy among the
optimates which reveals itself in the sources but which his
character hardly deserved.<a id="FNanchor_1969" href="#Footnote_1969" class="fnanchor">[1969]</a></p>

<p>Another popular tribune, C. Appuleius Decianus, 98, brought
against P. Furius the accusation that in the preceding year the
latter as tribune of the plebs had betrayed the people’s cause.
Acquitted of that charge, he was accused later in the year
by C. Canuleius, another tribune, on the ground that he had
impeded the return of Metellus.<a id="FNanchor_1970" href="#Footnote_1970" class="fnanchor">[1970]</a> In one of the contiones
for the trial of this case the citizens would not listen to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
defence of the accused but tore him in pieces. In the same
year Appuleius prosecuted L. Valerius Flaccus, curule aedile,
on what charge is unknown. His own condemnation to exile,
more probably by the centuries than by a quaestio, on the
ground that in his accusation of Furius he lamented the death
of Appuleius Saturninus, his gentilis, is mentioned in an earlier
chapter.<a id="FNanchor_1971" href="#Footnote_1971" class="fnanchor">[1971]</a></p>

<p>Sulla’s completion of the system of standing courts and his
restriction of the tribunician function of prosecution<a id="FNanchor_1972" href="#Footnote_1972" class="fnanchor">[1972]</a> substantially
withdrew all judicial power from the tribal assembly under
the presidency of tribunes. The overthrow of the Cornelian constitutional
arrangements left the standing courts with jurisdiction
unimpaired. Though constitutionally the tribunes by this
overthrow regained their right to prosecute, they exercised it
rarely and feebly during the remainder of the republic. C.
Memmius, tribune of the plebs in 66, brought M. Terentius
Varro Lucullus to trial for what he had done long before in his
quaestorship at the dictation of Sulla. As the motive was
evidently personal, the accused was acquitted.<a id="FNanchor_1973" href="#Footnote_1973" class="fnanchor">[1973]</a> Early in 58
L. Antistius, tribune of the plebs, in the interest of the optimates
threatened to prosecute C. Julius Caesar, who had just
retired from his consulship and was on the point of setting out
for his provinces. Caesar appealed to the other tribunes, who
suspended the prosecution on the ground that the accused was
to be necessarily absent in the service of the state.<a id="FNanchor_1974" href="#Footnote_1974" class="fnanchor">[1974]</a> In the
year 44 C. Epidius Marullus and L. Caesetius Flavius, tribunes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
instituted proceedings against the man who took the lead in
acclaiming Caesar king as he was returning from Alba. The
evident displeasure of Caesar at the accusation caused its withdrawal.<a id="FNanchor_1975" href="#Footnote_1975" class="fnanchor">[1975]</a>
In incomplete trials, like those last mentioned, it is
seldom possible to determine whether they were to come before
the centuries or the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1976" href="#Footnote_1976" class="fnanchor">[1976]</a></p>

<h4>II. <i>Aedilician Jurisdiction</i></h4>

<p>Before the Hortensian legislation the curule and plebeian
aediles alike had cognizance of usury, stuprum, and violation
of the law concerning the limitation of occupation and pasturage
of the public lands.<a id="FNanchor_1977" href="#Footnote_1977" class="fnanchor">[1977]</a> In the period now under consideration,
beginning in 287, they continued to exercise the same function
besides taking upon themselves some new cases. Aedilician
actions for violation of the pasturage clause of the Licinian-Sextian
statute took place in 240,<a id="FNanchor_1978" href="#Footnote_1978" class="fnanchor">[1978]</a> 196,<a id="FNanchor_1979" href="#Footnote_1979" class="fnanchor">[1979]</a> and 193.<a id="FNanchor_1980" href="#Footnote_1980" class="fnanchor">[1980]</a> Closely
related is the fining of usurers in 192,<a id="FNanchor_1981" href="#Footnote_1981" class="fnanchor">[1981]</a> and of grain dealers for
cornering the market in 189.<a id="FNanchor_1982" href="#Footnote_1982" class="fnanchor">[1982]</a> In 157 C. Furius Chresimus was
prosecuted by a curule aedile for injuring the crops of others by
magic, and the case came before the tribes in the Forum. By
bringing his farm tools into the assembly and calling them his
instruments of magic he induced the citizens to vote his acquittal.<a id="FNanchor_1983" href="#Footnote_1983" class="fnanchor">[1983]</a></p>

<p>There are several known cases of criminal lust which fell
within the aedilician cognizance. In 227 C. Scantinus Capitolinus
during his term of office as tribune or aedile of the plebs
was prosecuted by M. Claudius Marcellus, curule aedile, on a
charge of attempted paederastia. He called attention to the
sanctity of his person; but as the tribunes refused to protect
him on that ground, he was condemned by the people.<a id="FNanchor_1984" href="#Footnote_1984" class="fnanchor">[1984]</a> Most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
of the known cases of this general character were against
women. Several matrons, accused of stuprum by the plebeian
aediles of 213 and fined by the comitia tributa, retired into
exile.<a id="FNanchor_1985" href="#Footnote_1985" class="fnanchor">[1985]</a> About the time of the war with Hannibal a charge of
incest, based on the fact of intermarriage between close relatives
and brought doubtless by an aedile, was judged favorably to
the accused by the people.<a id="FNanchor_1986" href="#Footnote_1986" class="fnanchor">[1986]</a> The curule aedile A. Hostilius
Mancinus, 183, brought to trial before the tribal assembly Manilia,
a courtesan, who, he alleged, had thrown a stone at him in the
night and had wounded him. Manilia, appealing to the tribunes,
explained that he was attempting violently to break into her
house, when she repulsed him with stones. Thereupon the
tribunes decreed that the prosecutor deserved the treatment he
had received. They interceded against his action, which accordingly
had to be dropped.<a id="FNanchor_1987" href="#Footnote_1987" class="fnanchor">[1987]</a></p>

<p>One case of perduellio under aedilician jurisdiction is recorded.
In 246 Claudia, sister of that P. Claudius Pulcher who lost his
fleet off Drepanum,<a id="FNanchor_1988" href="#Footnote_1988" class="fnanchor">[1988]</a> was jostled by the crowd as she came from
the games. She was heard to say on this occasion that she
wondered what would have happened to herself, had her brother
not caused the death of so many of the citizens, and to wish that
he were again living, to lose another fleet together with the
crowd that troubled her. For these words she was brought to
trial by the aediles of the plebs, and the people imposed on her
a fine of 25,000 heavy asses.<a id="FNanchor_1989" href="#Footnote_1989" class="fnanchor">[1989]</a> The case is described as a
iudicium maiestatis apud populum Romanum.<a id="FNanchor_1990" href="#Footnote_1990" class="fnanchor">[1990]</a></p>

<p>The jurisdiction of the aediles as well as that of the tribunes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
suffered from the growth of standing courts.<a id="FNanchor_1991" href="#Footnote_1991" class="fnanchor">[1991]</a> The fact that
the power remained, provided the holder was in a position to
use it, is proved by the occasional recurrence of a prosecution
in the lifetime of Cicero. First may be mentioned the proceedings
instituted by C. Flavius Fimbria, aedile in 86, against Q.
Scaevola. Evidently the case did not come to vote.<a id="FNanchor_1992" href="#Footnote_1992" class="fnanchor">[1992]</a> Interesting
is the threat of Cicero<a id="FNanchor_1993" href="#Footnote_1993" class="fnanchor">[1993]</a> as curule aedile to bring to trial
before the people C. Verres and all who should by bribery aid
his acquittal. The circumstance that Cicero was ready to place
so great a function upon the aedileship is proof of the confusion
into which the ideas of popular jurisdiction had fallen through
infrequent use.<a id="FNanchor_1994" href="#Footnote_1994" class="fnanchor">[1994]</a> Another anomaly is the prosecution begun by
P. Clodius against T. Annius Milo on the charge of violence
(vis).<a id="FNanchor_1995" href="#Footnote_1995" class="fnanchor">[1995]</a> It took place in the Forum before the comitia tributa,
but we do not know whether it came to a vote.</p>

<h4>III. <i>Pontifical Jurisdiction</i></h4>

<p>In the exercise of his disciplinary power the supreme pontiff
sometimes imposed a fine on a sacerdos under his authority.
An appeal to the thirty-five tribes was allowed, if the amount of
the penalty reached the appealable limit.<a id="FNanchor_1996" href="#Footnote_1996" class="fnanchor">[1996]</a> After the analogy
of the civil magistrate the pontiff presided over the assembly
during the trial.<a id="FNanchor_1997" href="#Footnote_1997" class="fnanchor">[1997]</a> In 189 Q. Fabius Pictor, who was at the
same time praetor and flamen Quirinalis, was forbidden by the
supreme pontiff to go to the province assigned him. After
much contention the pontiff imposed a fine, and an appeal was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
taken to the people, who decided that the flamen must obey the
pontifex maximus, and on that condition remitted the fine.<a id="FNanchor_1998" href="#Footnote_1998" class="fnanchor">[1998]</a> In
180 L. Cornelius Dolabella was fined for refusal to resign his
office of naval duumvir that he might be inaugurated rex sacrificulus.
The case was decided as the preceding, but an unfavorable
omen which dissolved the assembly deterred the pontiffs
from inaugurating him.<a id="FNanchor_1999" href="#Footnote_1999" class="fnanchor">[1999]</a> A similar case occurred in 131.<a id="FNanchor_2000" href="#Footnote_2000" class="fnanchor">[2000]</a> In
the appeal of Claudius, an augur, from a pontifical fine, the
date of which is unknown, though it probably followed the
trials above mentioned, the people sustained the accused.<a id="FNanchor_2001" href="#Footnote_2001" class="fnanchor">[2001]</a>
These are the few recorded cases of appeal from sacerdotal
jurisdiction. The moderation of the pontifex maximus, together
with the respect of his sacerdotes for religion, usually
served to prevent the need of recourse to the people. It is a
noteworthy fact that the custom was practically conterminous
with the era of the most highly developed plutocracy. The
circumstance that in all the cases known to have fallen within
this period the people confirmed the authority of the pontiff
affords striking evidence of the perfection to which the optimates
had now brought the religious machinery of their political
system.<a id="FNanchor_2002" href="#Footnote_2002" class="fnanchor">[2002]</a></p>

<p>From what has been said on the judicial functions of the
comitia in this and earlier chapters, it is clear that the jurisdiction
of the people is inseparably connected with the political
and constitutional history of Rome. Beginning feebly in the
early republic, the right of appeal was most intensely exercised
from the middle of the third to the middle of the second century
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Its decline thereafter, owing mainly to the rise of the
quaestiones, was a symptom of the general decay of the republic.</p>

<h4>I. <i>An Era of Repose</i><br />
287-232</h4>

<p>The Hortensian enactment which raised the plebiscite to an
equality with the lex and gave the tribunician initiative full
constitutional freedom<a id="FNanchor_2003" href="#Footnote_2003" class="fnanchor">[2003]</a> seems to have been especially calculated
to prepare for a splendid outburst of legislative energy. No
such result, however, was actually reached. Circumstances
prove the leaders of the plebs to have been well satisfied with
the political gains thus far made as regards (1) their place in
the senate assured them by the Ovinian statute,<a id="FNanchor_2004" href="#Footnote_2004" class="fnanchor">[2004]</a> (2) their right
to the magistracies, confirmed by various laws, (3) the powers
of the tribunate and its relation to the senate established by the
Hortensian statute. Content with their position as a branch
of the widened nobility, inferior neither politically nor socially
to the patrician branch, and happy in the enjoyment of authority,
they were now as much inclined as the patricians to discourage
and to resist further aggression on the part of the plain
citizens. Their control of the initiative in legislation was the
chief means of forwarding this policy. Their respect for the
senate, in which they were now rapidly becoming the dominant
party, was such that they were willing to forego the recently
acquired privilege of bringing their rogations before the people
without the senatorial sanction. But in case a tribune was so
bold and so out of harmony with his political peers as to offer
an unsanctioned bill, they could count on the intercession of
one of his colleagues; if matters came to an extremity, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
senate could annul the act after its adoption by declaring it
illegal or contrary to the auspices.<a id="FNanchor_2005" href="#Footnote_2005" class="fnanchor">[2005]</a> Evidently the plebeian
nobles were aware, too, that with the increase in the number of
citizens and with their dispersion over Italy the assembly had
ceased to represent the citizen body, and was failing in ability
to grapple with the new and increasingly complex problems of
administration created by the widening of the Roman domain.<a id="FNanchor_2006" href="#Footnote_2006" class="fnanchor">[2006]</a></p>

<p>Under these new conditions the assemblies continued, it is
true, to elect their annual magistrates and to receive appeals
from the judicial decisions of the latter, more rarely to declare
war or to ratify a treaty. Occasionally they passed a law to
increase the number of magistrates or to regulate elections;
but for the fifty-five years following the Hortensian legislation,
287-232, there is no record of the enactment of a distinctly
administrative law. The silence of history on this point is due
not so much to the exceptionally scant sources<a id="FNanchor_2007" href="#Footnote_2007" class="fnanchor">[2007]</a> as to a lack of
comitial activity.</p>

<p>First among the statutes relating to the election of magistrates
is to be placed the Maenian plebiscite, adopted in 287 or
thereabout, which directed the patres in case of elections, as
the Publilian statute had directed them in case of rogations,<a id="FNanchor_2008" href="#Footnote_2008" class="fnanchor">[2008]</a>
to give their auctoritas before the voting began, while the
issue was still uncertain.<a id="FNanchor_2009" href="#Footnote_2009" class="fnanchor">[2009]</a> Blocking the last efforts of the patricians
to monopolize the consulship,<a id="FNanchor_2010" href="#Footnote_2010" class="fnanchor">[2010]</a> the act completed the
reduction of the patrum auctoritas to a formality. The sources
represent Appius Claudius Caecus as the chief offender whom
this law was designed to rebuke. His personality had brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
to the censorship an enormous accretion of power which disturbed
the constitutional balance. In this period that magistracy
assumed also the function of supervising the morals of the
citizens.<a id="FNanchor_2011" href="#Footnote_2011" class="fnanchor">[2011]</a> To check this disproportionate growth a law, probably
tribunician, of 265 forbade reëlection to the office.<a id="FNanchor_2012" href="#Footnote_2012" class="fnanchor">[2012]</a></p>

<p>The Romans created no more absolutely new magistratus
ordinarii. In 267, however, probably by an act of the comitia
tributa, they doubled the number of quaestors—from four to
eight—in order that the new members of the college might
attend to the financial business of the government at various
points in Italy.<a id="FNanchor_2013" href="#Footnote_2013" class="fnanchor">[2013]</a> A second praetor was created in 242,<a id="FNanchor_2014" href="#Footnote_2014" class="fnanchor">[2014]</a> doubtless
by a law, not only for jurisdiction inter peregrinos but also
for increasing the number of magistrates available for military
commands.<a id="FNanchor_2015" href="#Footnote_2015" class="fnanchor">[2015]</a> The tresviri capitales, instituted in 289,<a id="FNanchor_2016" href="#Footnote_2016" class="fnanchor">[2016]</a> were
given the rank of magistrate by a plebiscite of L. Papirius,
adopted after 242, which directed the urban praetor to elect
these officials in the comitia tributa.<a id="FNanchor_2017" href="#Footnote_2017" class="fnanchor">[2017]</a> In 241 the people, probably
in tribal assembly, granted to L. Caecilius Metellus on
account of his blindness the privilege of riding to the Curia in a
carriage.<a id="FNanchor_2018" href="#Footnote_2018" class="fnanchor">[2018]</a></p>

<p>One statute referred to this period<a id="FNanchor_2019" href="#Footnote_2019" class="fnanchor">[2019]</a> belongs to the domain of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
private law. The first chapter of the tribunician lex Aquilia
provided “that if a slave of another man, or a quadruped of his
cattle, be unlawfully slain, whatever within a year is the highest
value thereof, that amount the offender shall pay to the owner.”<a id="FNanchor_2020" href="#Footnote_2020" class="fnanchor">[2020]</a>
The second chapter secured the principal stipulator against
adstipulators, and the third provided for all other kinds of
damage.<a id="FNanchor_2021" href="#Footnote_2021" class="fnanchor">[2021]</a> It superseded all previous statutes on the subject,
including that of the Twelve Tables.</p>

<h4>II. <i>The Flaminian Era</i><a id="FNanchor_2022" href="#Footnote_2022" class="fnanchor">[2022]</a><br />
232-201</h4>

<p>Such is the scant list of legislative acts of the half century
following the dictatorship of Hortensius (287-232), none of
them as innovating as, for instance, the reform of the comitia
centuriata brought about in approximately the same period by
the power of the censors alone.<a id="FNanchor_2023" href="#Footnote_2023" class="fnanchor">[2023]</a> The nobles had a certain
degree of reason for feeling secure in their control of the
administration. But in this respect they miscalculated. The
long war with Carthage, which had diverted the attention of all
the citizens from politics, ended without bringing in the wake
of victory the usual rewards to the masses. No lands in Sicily
were assigned to the citizens, while on their northeastern border
the Picene district and the territory recently taken from the
Gauls in the neighborhood of Ariminum were reserved by the
nobles for their own occupation. Popular discontent at these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
short-sighted, selfish proceedings found expression in the rogation
of C. Flaminius, tribune of the plebs in 232, for the assignment
of the lands here mentioned to the citizens who were
willing to settle on the frontier.<a id="FNanchor_2024" href="#Footnote_2024" class="fnanchor">[2024]</a> It was vehemently opposed
by the nobility,<a id="FNanchor_2025" href="#Footnote_2025" class="fnanchor">[2025]</a> and was finally passed without the authorization
of a senatus consultum.<a id="FNanchor_2026" href="#Footnote_2026" class="fnanchor">[2026]</a> From a statement of Cicero<a id="FNanchor_2027" href="#Footnote_2027" class="fnanchor">[2027]</a> that
as long afterward as 228 Q. Fabius Maximus, then consul a
second time, was hindering Flaminius from dividing the land,
we may infer that the author of the law was elected among the
tresviri charged with its administration.<a id="FNanchor_2028" href="#Footnote_2028" class="fnanchor">[2028]</a> Most of the settlers
in that region were assigned to the tribe Velina, probably in
pursuance of an article of the Flaminian statute.<a id="FNanchor_2029" href="#Footnote_2029" class="fnanchor">[2029]</a> The enactment
came as a disagreeable interruption to the quiet happiness
of the nobles—as a sign that the political battle fought out
between comitia and senate in the period ending with the Hortensian
legislation was to be renewed with perhaps even greater
bitterness. Hence Polybius, echoing the complaints of the
nobles, denounces the measure as the first step toward the
demoralization of the people.<a id="FNanchor_2030" href="#Footnote_2030" class="fnanchor">[2030]</a> The lasting hatred felt by the
senators for this new and powerful enemy is seen in their
refusal to grant him a triumph for military successes he had
won as consul in 223. A plebiscite without their authorization
gave the desired privilege to the champion of popular rights.<a id="FNanchor_2031" href="#Footnote_2031" class="fnanchor">[2031]</a>
It was probably in this connection—at least we are soon to
hear of it for the first time—that an act of the people was
made essential to a triumph within the city. Henceforth even
when the senate was willing to allow a triumph or an ovation,
the person thus honored could not hold imperium in the city on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
the day of such festival excepting by a comitial lex. Usually
in cases of the kind the senate, after voting the privilege,
instructed a praetor to request one of the tribunes to
bring a rogatio de imperio before the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_2032" href="#Footnote_2032" class="fnanchor">[2032]</a> The earliest
known act of the kind is the plebiscite of 211 which granted
the imperium to M. Marcellus, proconsul on the day of his
ovation.<a id="FNanchor_2033" href="#Footnote_2033" class="fnanchor">[2033]</a></p>

<p>The popular party had not long to wait for an opportunity
to retaliate upon the senate for the slight it had offered their
champion. On the precedent of the Ovinian law<a id="FNanchor_2034" href="#Footnote_2034" class="fnanchor">[2034]</a> the people
had a right to legislate concerning the honors, privileges, and
qualifications of its individual members.<a id="FNanchor_2035" href="#Footnote_2035" class="fnanchor">[2035]</a> In 219 accordingly
the plebiscite of Q. Claudius, known to have been supported
in the senate by C. Flaminius alone, who was then censor, prohibited
senators and their sons from owning sea-going ships of
more than three hundred amphoras capacity.<a id="FNanchor_2036" href="#Footnote_2036" class="fnanchor">[2036]</a> It was probably
an article of this statute which forbade the same class of persons
to take contracts from the government, with the reservation of
such economically insignificant agreements as concerned worship.<a id="FNanchor_2037" href="#Footnote_2037" class="fnanchor">[2037]</a>
The peasants, whose interests Flaminius represented,
opposed the renewal of the war with Carthage, regarding it as
a means of extending the field of commerce and speculation of
the nobles. This law therefore expresses the determination of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
the country people that the senatorial families should no longer
share the advantages of such wars. From the point of view
of the statesman it was the first step toward the separation
of the governing class from the commercial class, with a view to
guarding against the administration of the government in the
sole interest of capital. The result was not all that could be
desired; the senatorial families found secret ways of placing a
great part of their funds in commercial companies; and in so
far as the law was actually effective, it compelled senators to
invest money in Italian land<a id="FNanchor_2038" href="#Footnote_2038" class="fnanchor">[2038]</a>—a proceeding which contributed
largely to the economic ruin of the peninsula.</p>

<p>In the administration of finance, which in spite of occasional
interference on the part of the comitia remained with the senate,
is included the regulation of coinage. The comitia passed few
acts relating to the subject. The earliest known to history is
the misnamed lex minus solvendi of C. Flaminius, consul in
217, which introduced the uncial standard for the as, making
for ordinary use sixteen asses of an ounce weight equivalent to
ten old—in other words, to the denarius.<a id="FNanchor_2039" href="#Footnote_2039" class="fnanchor">[2039]</a> In the payment of
soldiers, however, the denarius was still reckoned at ten asses.<a id="FNanchor_2040" href="#Footnote_2040" class="fnanchor">[2040]</a>
Probably the same law regulated the issue of plated silver
denarii<a id="FNanchor_2041" href="#Footnote_2041" class="fnanchor">[2041]</a> and of gold coins.<a id="FNanchor_2042" href="#Footnote_2042" class="fnanchor">[2042]</a> The debtor’s gain was offset by
the actual decrease in the weight of the <i>as</i> to a little more than
an ounce before the enactment of the law.<a id="FNanchor_2043" href="#Footnote_2043" class="fnanchor">[2043]</a> This measure was
followed the next year by the plebiscite of M. Minucius, which
created the triumviri mensarii, a banking commission for relieving
the great lack of money (216).<a id="FNanchor_2044" href="#Footnote_2044" class="fnanchor">[2044]</a> The board managed
some of the financial business of the state,<a id="FNanchor_2045" href="#Footnote_2045" class="fnanchor">[2045]</a> and undoubtedly
did what it could to strengthen private credit, which at this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
time was at a low ebb.<a id="FNanchor_2046" href="#Footnote_2046" class="fnanchor">[2046]</a> The next step taken by the comitia
was the enactment of a plebiscite within a field properly belonging
to the censors under senatorial supervision—the building
and repair of public works.<a id="FNanchor_2047" href="#Footnote_2047" class="fnanchor">[2047]</a> In 212 the act of an unknown
tribune, carried through the comitia with the consent of the
senate, created three temporary administrative boards—quinqueviri
for repairing the defences of the city, triumviri to seek
for property belonging to the temples and to register gifts, and
another board of three for repairing the temples of Fortune,
Mater Matuta, and Hope. These officials were to be elected
by the tribes under the chairmanship of the urban praetor.<a id="FNanchor_2048" href="#Footnote_2048" class="fnanchor">[2048]</a>
Nearly related is the plebiscite of 210, which in pursuance of a
senatus consultum directed the censors to farm the vectigalia
of the Campanian territory.<a id="FNanchor_2049" href="#Footnote_2049" class="fnanchor">[2049]</a> Evidently in the trying time of
the war with Hannibal the senate found it advisable to conciliate
the citizens by voluntarily bringing a few administrative measures
of the kind before it. All this legislation was due more or
less directly to the influence of Flaminius. A succession of
sumptuary laws may be likewise traced to his second consulship,
217. The Twelve Tables contained a number of laws relating
to funerals, designed to preserve good order and to prevent
extravagant expense.<a id="FNanchor_2050" href="#Footnote_2050" class="fnanchor">[2050]</a> After their ratification the authority
of the magistrates and especially of the censors sufficed for
the maintenance of good conduct, till in the period of the Punic
wars the character of the people began to suffer deterioration,
whereupon the assemblies undertook to enact new laws for the
enforcement of morality. One of the earliest was the lex alearia,
which prohibited the game of dice. Its mention by Plautus
makes it prior to 204.<a id="FNanchor_2051" href="#Footnote_2051" class="fnanchor">[2051]</a> The name of the author is not given;
and for that reason we cannot be sure that it was a comitial law.<a id="FNanchor_2052" href="#Footnote_2052" class="fnanchor">[2052]</a>
To the same period belongs the plebiscite of P. and M. Silius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
concerning weights and measures.<a id="FNanchor_2053" href="#Footnote_2053" class="fnanchor">[2053]</a> The first comitial sumptuary
statute is the lex Metilia (217), probably tribunician, passed
under the influence of C. Flaminius and L. Aemilius, who were
censors in 220. It prescribed certain rules for the preparation
of cloth.<a id="FNanchor_2054" href="#Footnote_2054" class="fnanchor">[2054]</a> The object, in Lange’s<a id="FNanchor_2055" href="#Footnote_2055" class="fnanchor">[2055]</a> opinion, was to strike at the
luxury of the nobles through the guild of fullers. It was a
warning to them, he asserts, which however they failed to heed.
If this was indeed the object, the means were surprisingly feeble.
The next sumptuary law was the plebiscite of C. Oppius, 215,
directed against the luxury of wealthy women. It forbade a
woman to wear more than a half ounce of gold or a dress of
various colors or to ride in a carriage in a city or town or within
a mile of either, excepting when engaged in public worship.<a id="FNanchor_2056" href="#Footnote_2056" class="fnanchor">[2056]</a>
The author must have sympathized with the tendency of Flaminius,
and the law was supported, or at least not opposed, by
the nobility. Twenty years afterward their best representatives
strove in vain to maintain it against the rising tide of wealth
and luxury.<a id="FNanchor_2057" href="#Footnote_2057" class="fnanchor">[2057]</a></p>

<p>The influence of Flaminius on legislation may be traced still
farther. Under the economic distress of the war with Hannibal
the plebs began to lapse into clientage to the nobles. In
spite of the principle that the patron should accept no honorarium
for legal service,<a id="FNanchor_2058" href="#Footnote_2058" class="fnanchor">[2058]</a> the nobles began by the requisition of
gifts to render the commons tributary to themselves.<a id="FNanchor_2059" href="#Footnote_2059" class="fnanchor">[2059]</a> The
chief occasion for these exactions was found in the Saturnalia,
which was reconstituted in 217.<a id="FNanchor_2060" href="#Footnote_2060" class="fnanchor">[2060]</a> To check the abuse the Publician
plebiscite mentioned by Macrobius,<a id="FNanchor_2061" href="#Footnote_2061" class="fnanchor">[2061]</a> undoubtedly of C.
Publicius Bibulus, the popular tribune of 209,<a id="FNanchor_2062" href="#Footnote_2062" class="fnanchor">[2062]</a> prohibited all
gifts from the poor to the rich on that festival with the exception<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
of wax candles. It was supplemented in 204 by the plebiscite
of M. Cincius Alimentus,<a id="FNanchor_2063" href="#Footnote_2063" class="fnanchor">[2063]</a> which absolutely forbade gifts
and fees for legal service.<a id="FNanchor_2064" href="#Footnote_2064" class="fnanchor">[2064]</a> The prohibition of a magistrate’s
acceptance of gifts for the performance of official duty was undoubtedly
included in it.<a id="FNanchor_2065" href="#Footnote_2065" class="fnanchor">[2065]</a> Moreover it forbade all gifts above a
specified amount, but with exceptions in favor of various relatives
and benefactors.<a id="FNanchor_2066" href="#Footnote_2066" class="fnanchor">[2066]</a></p>

<p>It is not unlikely that the Flaminian age saw the earliest
comitial legislation governing judicial procedure in private
cases.<a id="FNanchor_2067" href="#Footnote_2067" class="fnanchor">[2067]</a> Some changes were wrought, too, in family law by
popular vote. In early time intermarriage between persons of
the sixth degree of kinship was forbidden by usage;<a id="FNanchor_2068" href="#Footnote_2068" class="fnanchor">[2068]</a> but in the
period between the first and second Punic wars the right was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
extended to relatives of the fifth and sixth degrees,<a id="FNanchor_2069" href="#Footnote_2069" class="fnanchor">[2069]</a> and shortly
afterward to those of the fourth degree (consobrini).<a id="FNanchor_2070" href="#Footnote_2070" class="fnanchor">[2070]</a> Another
law, the lex Atilia, enacted between 242 and 186,<a id="FNanchor_2071" href="#Footnote_2071" class="fnanchor">[2071]</a> probably in
the second Punic war,<a id="FNanchor_2072" href="#Footnote_2072" class="fnanchor">[2072]</a> directed the urban praetor to appoint a
tutor for a woman or child who was left without a natural protector.<a id="FNanchor_2073" href="#Footnote_2073" class="fnanchor">[2073]</a>
It now became possible, too, for a magistrate under
justifying circumstances to place a young man under twenty-five
in the care of a curator, in accordance with the Plaetorian
law,<a id="FNanchor_2074" href="#Footnote_2074" class="fnanchor">[2074]</a> which was enacted before 192,<a id="FNanchor_2075" href="#Footnote_2075" class="fnanchor">[2075]</a> and which belongs therefore
to the Flaminian age.<a id="FNanchor_2076" href="#Footnote_2076" class="fnanchor">[2076]</a></p>

<p>In the same period we find the comitia active in other fields.
In 215 a tribal law of an unknown author granted the citizenship
to three hundred Campanian knights who had remained
faithful to Rome, and assigned them to the municipium of
Cumae.<a id="FNanchor_2077" href="#Footnote_2077" class="fnanchor">[2077]</a> Following a precedent set by the Antistian plebiscite
of 319,<a id="FNanchor_2078" href="#Footnote_2078" class="fnanchor">[2078]</a> L. Atilius, tribune of the plebs in 210, carried a law, in
pursuance of a senatus consultum, for granting the senate absolute
power over the Campanians who had revolted;<a id="FNanchor_2079" href="#Footnote_2079" class="fnanchor">[2079]</a> and the
senate accordingly not only punished them with loss of citizenship
but reduced them to miserable subjection.<a id="FNanchor_2080" href="#Footnote_2080" class="fnanchor">[2080]</a> The right of
the comitia to ratify a vow of a sacred spring was recognized in
217 by an opinion rendered by the pontiffs,<a id="FNanchor_2081" href="#Footnote_2081" class="fnanchor">[2081]</a> and was first exercised
through a plebiscite of that year.<a id="FNanchor_2082" href="#Footnote_2082" class="fnanchor">[2082]</a> The appointment of
commissioners for the dedication of temples also belonged to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
the assembly,<a id="FNanchor_2083" href="#Footnote_2083" class="fnanchor">[2083]</a> as well as the regulation of religious festivals.<a id="FNanchor_2084" href="#Footnote_2084" class="fnanchor">[2084]</a>
The greatest gain made by the people within the province of
religious legislation in the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> was the provision
for electing the pontifex maximus by seventeen tribes drawn by
lot from the whole number thirty-five and presided over by a
pontiff. This innovation probably belongs to the Flaminian era
and certainly to the time before 212, when the first instance of
such an election is given.<a id="FNanchor_2085" href="#Footnote_2085" class="fnanchor">[2085]</a> The act was followed by another,
before 209, which authorized the election of the chief curio in
the same way.<a id="FNanchor_2086" href="#Footnote_2086" class="fnanchor">[2086]</a> The object was to take the control of these
places from the nobles, who looked upon the great sacerdotal
collegia as a main support of their political power.<a id="FNanchor_2087" href="#Footnote_2087" class="fnanchor">[2087]</a> It was but
the beginning of a movement for transferring the appointment
of all members of these collegia to the comitia sacerdotum, made
up as above described. In the peculiar composition of assemblies
of this character we see an attempt to make the gods in
some degree coadjutors of the populace in filling the sacred
places.<a id="FNanchor_2088" href="#Footnote_2088" class="fnanchor">[2088]</a></p>

<p>The assembly was merely exercising a long-recognized right<a id="FNanchor_2089" href="#Footnote_2089" class="fnanchor">[2089]</a>
in the institution of two new praetors in 227, for which we are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
warranted in assuming a legislative act.<a id="FNanchor_2090" href="#Footnote_2090" class="fnanchor">[2090]</a> The same observation
applies to the increase in the number of elective military
tribunes from sixteen to twenty-four in 207,<a id="FNanchor_2091" href="#Footnote_2091" class="fnanchor">[2091]</a> which was evidently
a concession to the commons. As the senate generally
attended to the prolongation of the imperium,<a id="FNanchor_2092" href="#Footnote_2092" class="fnanchor">[2092]</a> the confirmation
of a senatorial decree to that effect by an act of the people in
208<a id="FNanchor_2093" href="#Footnote_2093" class="fnanchor">[2093]</a> was exceptional. Far more radical was the plebiscite of
M. Metilius, 217, for equalizing the power of the dictator with
that of the master of horse.<a id="FNanchor_2094" href="#Footnote_2094" class="fnanchor">[2094]</a> This act and the resort to election
for filling the office<a id="FNanchor_2095" href="#Footnote_2095" class="fnanchor">[2095]</a> destroyed the value of the institution.<a id="FNanchor_2096" href="#Footnote_2096" class="fnanchor">[2096]</a> A
violent departure from usage was attempted in 209 by the rogation
of C. Publicius Bibulus, tribune of the plebs, for abrogating
the proconsular imperium of M. Claudius Marcellus. On this
occasion not merely the plebs but all classes attended the
assembly, which by an overwhelming vote rejected the proposition.<a id="FNanchor_2097" href="#Footnote_2097" class="fnanchor">[2097]</a>
Three quarters of a century were to pass before a law of
the kind could actually carry.<a id="FNanchor_2098" href="#Footnote_2098" class="fnanchor">[2098]</a></p>

<p>A plebiscite known to have been in force in the time of the
second Punic war<a id="FNanchor_2099" href="#Footnote_2099" class="fnanchor">[2099]</a> debarred from the tribunate and aedileship
of the plebs any person during the lifetime of a father or
grandfather who had filled a curule office. As the aim was
to free the plebeian officials from the influence of the nobility,
exercised through the patria potestas, that they might be in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
a better position to serve the interests of their constituents,
we may reasonably suppose this measure to have passed in
the time of Flaminius and under his influence. The tendency
was to widen the breach then forming between the nobility
and the commons.<a id="FNanchor_2100" href="#Footnote_2100" class="fnanchor">[2100]</a> The right of the people to dispense from
the law was acknowledged by the senate in 217, when, after
the destruction of the army at Trasimene and the death of
Flaminius, the patres authorized a plebiscite for dispensing
the consulars for the remainder of the war from the Genucian
plebiscite which forbade reëlection to the same office excepting
after an interval of ten years.<a id="FNanchor_2101" href="#Footnote_2101" class="fnanchor">[2101]</a></p>

<p>From what has been given above it is clear that Flaminius
began a new era in legislation, by no change in the constitution,
but rather by assuming the free initiative granted the
tribunes of the plebs through the Hortensian statute. Under
the influence of his personality the comitia recovered the
share in the administration which they had lost in the half
century of lethargy just passed, and even made new inroads
into the province of magisterial and senatorial authority. While
the disaster at Cannae, following hard upon that of Trasimene,
subdued the rising spirit of popular independence, it made
the senate more conciliatory,<a id="FNanchor_2102" href="#Footnote_2102" class="fnanchor">[2102]</a> with the result that neither did
the comitia lapse into its former repose nor did the nobles
lose their hold on the government. It was to this era, more
definitely to the opening of the war with Hannibal, that the
description of the constitution by Polybius<a id="FNanchor_2103" href="#Footnote_2103" class="fnanchor">[2103]</a> applies. The
political condition of Rome was improving,<a id="FNanchor_2104" href="#Footnote_2104" class="fnanchor">[2104]</a> or was just at its
zenith.<a id="FNanchor_2105" href="#Footnote_2105" class="fnanchor">[2105]</a> As the senate was at the height of its power, public
measures were deliberated upon, not by the many, but by
the best men.<a id="FNanchor_2106" href="#Footnote_2106" class="fnanchor">[2106]</a> Political life was sound, elections were pure,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
and a scrupulous fear of the gods remained the strongest
support of the commonwealth.<a id="FNanchor_2107" href="#Footnote_2107" class="fnanchor">[2107]</a> At this epoch the three chief
constitutional elements—magistrates, senate, and comitia—were
so perfectly balanced that even a native would hardly
be able to say whether the form of government was monarchy,
aristocracy, or democracy.<a id="FNanchor_2108" href="#Footnote_2108" class="fnanchor">[2108]</a> In this equilibrium of forces, in
this mutual power of checking or strengthening, lay the might
and the excellence of the constitution.<a id="FNanchor_2109" href="#Footnote_2109" class="fnanchor">[2109]</a></p>

<p>It is solely with the place of the assemblies in this system
that we are at present concerned. Inasmuch as the consuls
were supreme masters of the home administration, as well
as of the actual conduct of war,<a id="FNanchor_2110" href="#Footnote_2110" class="fnanchor">[2110]</a> and as the senate controlled
finance, diplomacy, and all interstate judicial business affecting
the Italian allies,<a id="FNanchor_2111" href="#Footnote_2111" class="fnanchor">[2111]</a> what part in the government could have
been left to the people? Polybius answers a most weighty
part. They are constitutionally the sole fountain of honor
and punishment, by which alone governments and societies
are held together. Not only are they in a position to discriminate
between the fit and the unfit in elections to office, but
they are the sole court for trying cases involving life and
death. The death penalty, however, may be avoided by voluntary
exile, if undertaken before a majority has been reached
in the process of voting.<a id="FNanchor_2112" href="#Footnote_2112" class="fnanchor">[2112]</a> Even finable actions in which the
proposed penalty is considerable, especially when the accused
has held a higher magistracy, come before them. It is they
who bestow offices on the deserving—the most honorable
reward which the constitution grants to virtue. It is they
who have absolute power to decide concerning the adoption
or repeal of laws; and most important of all, it is they who
deliberate concerning war and peace, and who ratify or reject
proposals for alliances, truces, and treaties.<a id="FNanchor_2113" href="#Footnote_2113" class="fnanchor">[2113]</a> These facts
might lead one to suppose that the supreme power is with
the people and that the government is a democracy.<a id="FNanchor_2114" href="#Footnote_2114" class="fnanchor">[2114]</a> In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
domestic administration the consuls are dependent on them
for authorizing various kinds of business and are under obligations
to execute their decrees.<a id="FNanchor_2115" href="#Footnote_2115" class="fnanchor">[2115]</a> In war, however distant
from home, the consul must still court their favor, to secure
their ratification of his arrangements for peace; and on laying
down his office he is liable to prosecution before them for
maladministration.<a id="FNanchor_2116" href="#Footnote_2116" class="fnanchor">[2116]</a> Hence he can afford to neglect them no
more than he can the senate.<a id="FNanchor_2117" href="#Footnote_2117" class="fnanchor">[2117]</a></p>

<p>The senate, too, is dependent upon the people for ratifying
all serious penalties imposed by the courts, which are made up
of senators.<a id="FNanchor_2118" href="#Footnote_2118" class="fnanchor">[2118]</a> Similarly in matters directly concerning that body,
the people have power to accept or reject proposals for diminishing
its traditional authority, for depriving its members of
dignities or offices, or even for lessening their means of livelihood.<a id="FNanchor_2119" href="#Footnote_2119" class="fnanchor">[2119]</a>
But the greatest popular restriction upon its authority
is the tribunician veto, which can prevent it from passing a
decree or even from holding a meeting. As the tribunes are
under obligations to carry into effect the decisions of the people
and in every way to have regard for their wishes,—for this and
for the other reasons mentioned, the senate respects the people
and cannot fail to neglect their feelings.<a id="FNanchor_2120" href="#Footnote_2120" class="fnanchor">[2120]</a></p>

<p>From the foregoing remarks of Polybius it is clear that in
the political theory of his time the will of the multitude when
expressed by a comitial act prevailed, in other words that the
people were sovereign. Several checks on their action from
the side of the senate and magistrates he mentions, especially
the absolute power of life and death exercised by the consuls in
war over those under their command,<a id="FNanchor_2121" href="#Footnote_2121" class="fnanchor">[2121]</a> and the control over the
citizens wielded by the senate through the management of public
contracts and through filling the courts from its own number.
But the most important limitation, implied throughout this discussion
though never expressly mentioned, is the lack of popular
initiative. The people could convene for no business whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
unless summoned by a magistrate. They could consider no
other subject than that proposed to them by the president;
they could take no part in the deliberation excepting in so far
as the president granted permission to individuals; they could
merely vote yes or no on the question presented to them.<a id="FNanchor_2122" href="#Footnote_2122" class="fnanchor">[2122]</a>
Notwithstanding the theory of popular sovereignty these conditions
prevented the rise of a real democracy; they placed the
assemblies under the control of the magistrates, who as a rule,
including even the tribunes, were willing ministers of the senate.
The bridled masses were rendered more obedient by the disasters
of the war with Hannibal, and the nobles were soon
to grow arrogant and violent through a surfeit of wealth and
power.<a id="FNanchor_2123" href="#Footnote_2123" class="fnanchor">[2123]</a> Under these new circumstances the docility of the
commons made possible the thorough organization of plutocracy
on the basis of a democratic theory of government.</p>

<h4>III. <i>The Era of the Completed Plutocracy, based on
a Recognition of Popular Sovereignty</i><br />
201-134</h4>

<p>The period from the close of the war with Hannibal to
the tribunate of Ti. Gracchus is marked by no such display of
comitial energy as that which characterized either the pre-Hortensian
age or the epoch introduced by Flaminius. In
return for a spurious freedom and a pretended share in the
administration the assembly became the handmaid of the
plutocracy.</p>

<p>There was, as usual, some legislation of the old kind concerning
magistrates. In 198 the number of praetors was increased
to six.<a id="FNanchor_2124" href="#Footnote_2124" class="fnanchor">[2124]</a> The arrangement was modified by the consular statute
of M. Baebius, 181, which provided for the election of four and
six on alternate years,<a id="FNanchor_2125" href="#Footnote_2125" class="fnanchor">[2125]</a> with the object of giving the governors
of the Spains a biennial term.<a id="FNanchor_2126" href="#Footnote_2126" class="fnanchor">[2126]</a> The greedy office-seekers by
another statute brought about the repeal of this arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
in 179.<a id="FNanchor_2127" href="#Footnote_2127" class="fnanchor">[2127]</a> The only new office was that of the tresviri epulones,
instituted by a plebiscite of C. Licinius Lucullus, 196. Their
function was to attend to certain religious festivals, especially to
the feast of Jupiter held on November 13. The law provided
that these officials should wear the toga praetexta just as did
the pontiffs.<a id="FNanchor_2128" href="#Footnote_2128" class="fnanchor">[2128]</a></p>

<p>A stage in the development of the plutocracy and of its
control over the plebeian tribunate is marked by the enactment
of the lex annalis of L. Villius, tribune of the plebs in 180. This
statute not only fixed the ages at which men might sue for and
hold the various patrician magistracies,<a id="FNanchor_2129" href="#Footnote_2129" class="fnanchor">[2129]</a> but also, developing a
custom already in existence, established an interval, evidently of
two years,<a id="FNanchor_2130" href="#Footnote_2130" class="fnanchor">[2130]</a> between consecutive magistracies. The stated object
was to curb the greed for office which the young nobles were
manifesting<a id="FNanchor_2131" href="#Footnote_2131" class="fnanchor">[2131]</a> as well as the eagerness of the people to favor
such ambitious persons, and for that reason it received the
support of Cato.<a id="FNanchor_2132" href="#Footnote_2132" class="fnanchor">[2132]</a> While it prevented the Scipios and the
Flaminini from creating a dynastic oligarchy, by checking
the growth of exceptional talent and by subjecting statesmen
to a fixed routine of honors and functions it subordinated the
individual to the class, and in this way aided the consolidation
of the senatorial plutocracy.<a id="FNanchor_2133" href="#Footnote_2133" class="fnanchor">[2133]</a> To the same period, at all events
after 194,<a id="FNanchor_2134" href="#Footnote_2134" class="fnanchor">[2134]</a> belong the Licinian and Aebutian plebiscites, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
prohibited the presiding magistrate from offering as candidates
for any extraordinary office himself, his colleagues, and his
relations by blood or marriage. This measure, too, was to
prevent the formation of governing cliques and dynasties. In
151, the year after the third consulship of M. Claudius Marcellus,<a id="FNanchor_2135" href="#Footnote_2135" class="fnanchor">[2135]</a>
to check the further aggrandizement of this man as well
as the rise of similar personalities, a law, supported by Cato,<a id="FNanchor_2136" href="#Footnote_2136" class="fnanchor">[2136]</a>
absolutely forbade reëlection to the consulship.<a id="FNanchor_2137" href="#Footnote_2137" class="fnanchor">[2137]</a> Cato’s idea
may have been to expedite the advancement of novi homines;
but so far from accomplishing this object, the measure contributed
to the further subordination of the individual to the
plutocratic machine.<a id="FNanchor_2138" href="#Footnote_2138" class="fnanchor">[2138]</a> It may well have been in the same partisan
spirit rather than in the interest of political morality that
P. Cornelius and M. Baebius Tamphilus, consuls in 181, carried
a law ex auctoritate senatus for the prosecution of bribery. It
disqualified for office for ten years any person found guilty of
influencing an election through bribery or other illegal means.<a id="FNanchor_2139" href="#Footnote_2139" class="fnanchor">[2139]</a>
Probably through this measure the nobles aimed to curb the
greed of office in the more ambitious and unscrupulous of their
number; but it accomplished nothing, and was followed in 159
by another consular lex de ambitu of Cn. Cornelius Dolabella
and M. Fulvius Nobilior, which increased the penalty to death.<a id="FNanchor_2140" href="#Footnote_2140" class="fnanchor">[2140]</a>
Practically the punishment was exile. This law had no more
effect than the earlier; and the conduct of the nobles both
before and after its enactment proves that they did not intend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
by it to open the consulship to the competition of novi
homines.</p>

<p>The limitation upon the judicial imperium of magistrates and
promagistrates by the three Porcian laws of appeal, which
belong to this period, has been considered in connection with
popular jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_2141" href="#Footnote_2141" class="fnanchor">[2141]</a> The last of these acts affected the administration
of the provinces and of military affairs, which
belonged originally to the magistrates and the senate. It was
only by degrees that the people interfered in this department.
The earliest known act of the kind was the consular lex de
sumptu provinciali of M. Porcius Cato, 195, for limiting the
expenses of provincials in the support and honor of the governor.<a id="FNanchor_2142" href="#Footnote_2142" class="fnanchor">[2142]</a>
To prevent conflicts in the provinces between the incoming
and the retiring governor, Cato favored a regulation,
adopted probably in 177, whether a lex or a senatus consultum
has not been determined, to the effect that the imperium of the
outgoing functionary should cease on the arrival of the new.<a id="FNanchor_2143" href="#Footnote_2143" class="fnanchor">[2143]</a>
It was still more unusual for the people to take part in the
organization of a new province; but in 146 a lex Livia, probably
tribunician, commissioned P. Scipio Aemilianus, assisted by
ten legati, to organize the province of Africa.<a id="FNanchor_2144" href="#Footnote_2144" class="fnanchor">[2144]</a></p>

<p>In foreign affairs the assemblies took the same part as in the
preceding period; the centuries continued to declare war and
the tribes to ratify peace. In 196 the tribunician lex Marcia
Atinia compelled the consuls against their will to conclude a
treaty with Macedon.<a id="FNanchor_2145" href="#Footnote_2145" class="fnanchor">[2145]</a> In 149 L. Scribonius Libo, tribune of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
the plebs, attempted in vain to secure the adoption of a rogation
for restoring liberty to the Lusitanians, whom the praetor
Servius Galba had treacherously enslaved.<a id="FNanchor_2146" href="#Footnote_2146" class="fnanchor">[2146]</a> No less characteristic
of the age is the consular lex of L. Furius and Ser. Atilius,
136, for surrendering C. Mancinus to the Numantines because
without the consent of the senate he had made an unfavorable
treaty with them.<a id="FNanchor_2147" href="#Footnote_2147" class="fnanchor">[2147]</a> The deterioration in the character of Roman
generalship and warfare is indicated by a statute of unknown
authorship, enacted after 180,<a id="FNanchor_2148" href="#Footnote_2148" class="fnanchor">[2148]</a> which forbade a triumph to a
commander who had not killed at least five thousand of the
enemy in a single battle.<a id="FNanchor_2149" href="#Footnote_2149" class="fnanchor">[2149]</a> The intention of the law, however,
which obviously was to prevent commanders from triumphing
for fictitious or insignificant victories, was circumvented by falsifications
regarding the number of enemies slain or by triumphs
on the Alban Mount.<a id="FNanchor_2150" href="#Footnote_2150" class="fnanchor">[2150]</a></p>

<p>Whereas before the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> no mention is made
of a comitial act for the founding of a colony, in the beginning
of the period now under consideration the function was exercised
by the people three or four times in quick succession. In
197 was enacted the tribunician statute of C. Atinius for planting
five colonies—Vulturnum, Liternum, Puteoli, Salernum,
and Buxentum—on the coast of Italy, each to consist of three
hundred families, the execution of the measure to be in the
hands of triumviri, who were to hold their office three years.<a id="FNanchor_2151" href="#Footnote_2151" class="fnanchor">[2151]</a>
Not long afterward a plebiscite of Q. Aelius Tubero provided
for founding two Latin colonies, one in Bruttium, the other at
Thurii, each by triumviri, who likewise held office three years.
The measure was authorized by a senatus consultum, 194.<a id="FNanchor_2152" href="#Footnote_2152" class="fnanchor">[2152]</a> In
the same year a tribunician law of M. Baebius Tamphilus provided
for the establishment of three Roman colonies.<a id="FNanchor_2153" href="#Footnote_2153" class="fnanchor">[2153]</a> Mention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
of colonial legislation by the people then ceases. Although the
phenomenon may be due in some cases to the sources, this explanation
does not generally hold good, especially as the colonization
of the years 189<a id="FNanchor_2154" href="#Footnote_2154" class="fnanchor">[2154]</a> and 184<a id="FNanchor_2155" href="#Footnote_2155" class="fnanchor">[2155]</a> is expressly attributed to
the senate, and because Velleius<a id="FNanchor_2156" href="#Footnote_2156" class="fnanchor">[2156]</a> credits that body with the
founding of all the colonies from the Gallic conflagration to his
own time. Probably before the Gracchi a senatorial decree was
issued in every case, and though the commissioners for conducting
colonies were as a rule elected by the tribes after 296,<a id="FNanchor_2157" href="#Footnote_2157" class="fnanchor">[2157]</a> the
people were given but a taste of power within this administrative
field.<a id="FNanchor_2158" href="#Footnote_2158" class="fnanchor">[2158]</a></p>

<p>Early in the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> we find creditors rioting in
usury, unchecked by the various statutes which had been enacted
against the evil. They discovered a way of circumventing
the law by transferring their securities to citizens of an
allied state, who had a right to force the collection of debts
under the law of their own community. To put a stop to this
kind of fraud the senate decreed that after a stated date allies
who lent money to Roman citizens should register the transaction,
and that in suits for the collection of such money the debtor
should have the privilege of choosing under which law, whether
that of Rome or of the allied community, the suit against him
should be tried. As the registers provided for the purpose
showed that an enormous amount of fraud was still being committed
in circumvention of the law and of the senatorial act,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
M. Sempronius, tribune of the plebs in 193, ex auctoritate
patrum proposed and carried a statute which ordered that
money lent between a Roman citizen and one of a Latin or
other allied state should be collected under Roman law.<a id="FNanchor_2159" href="#Footnote_2159" class="fnanchor">[2159]</a> This
is one of the earliest instances of unfairness introduced by
Rome into the private relations between her citizens and those
of her allies.<a id="FNanchor_2160" href="#Footnote_2160" class="fnanchor">[2160]</a></p>

<p>Family law underwent some modification. A plebiscite of
Q. Voconius Saxa, 169,<a id="FNanchor_2161" href="#Footnote_2161" class="fnanchor">[2161]</a> provided that no citizen assessed at a
hundred thousand asses or more should will his property to a
woman.<a id="FNanchor_2162" href="#Footnote_2162" class="fnanchor">[2162]</a> Another article limited to a half of the estate the
amount which any legatee, male or female, could receive.<a id="FNanchor_2163" href="#Footnote_2163" class="fnanchor">[2163]</a>
Dowries were regulated by a lex Maenia, which seems to
belong to 186.<a id="FNanchor_2164" href="#Footnote_2164" class="fnanchor">[2164]</a></p>

<p>In the bestowal of the citizenship the people were unhampered.
Doubtless for some time after the Hortensian legislation
comitial acts for this purpose were commonly authorized
by senatus consulta; but in the year 188 we first hear the enunciation
of the principle that the people without the authority of
the senate had the power to bestow the ius suffragii on whomsoever
they pleased.<a id="FNanchor_2165" href="#Footnote_2165" class="fnanchor">[2165]</a> The principle was carried into immediate
effect by the tribunician statute of C. Valerius Tappo, which
without a senatus consultum conferred the right of suffrage on
the Formiani, Fundani, and Arpinates, who hitherto had been
cives sine suffragio. The determination of the tribe to which
new citizens should belong was also provided for by the legislative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
act of admission.<a id="FNanchor_2166" href="#Footnote_2166" class="fnanchor">[2166]</a> The citizenship granted in this period
continued occasionally to be limited. The Campanians, excluded
forever from the rights of the state in 210,<a id="FNanchor_2167" href="#Footnote_2167" class="fnanchor">[2167]</a> were in 188 placed
under the census by a senatus consultum of the preceding year
and were given intermarriage probably by a similar act.<a id="FNanchor_2168" href="#Footnote_2168" class="fnanchor">[2168]</a> In
early time, at least before 184, the custom arose of granting to
the founders of a colony the right to enroll as citizens a specified
number of aliens. The first recorded instance belongs to the
year mentioned, in which the poet Ennius received the citizenship
in accordance with such a law.<a id="FNanchor_2169" href="#Footnote_2169" class="fnanchor">[2169]</a> It was by the pretorian
comitia tributa that the priestesses of Ceres, who were Greeks
from Naples, Velia, or Sicily, were admitted to the citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_2170" href="#Footnote_2170" class="fnanchor">[2170]</a>
Perhaps by the same assembly, at all events by an act of the
people, a slave who deserved well of the state was given his
liberty, which involved citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_2171" href="#Footnote_2171" class="fnanchor">[2171]</a> Such grants to single individuals
by the people, however, must have been rare.<a id="FNanchor_2172" href="#Footnote_2172" class="fnanchor">[2172]</a> A
Roman taken captive in war, recovered all his rights simply by
returning home (postliminium).<a id="FNanchor_2173" href="#Footnote_2173" class="fnanchor">[2173]</a> But even when an entire community
was brought into the state by a single vote, the wording
of the law indicates that the inhabitants received the honor as
individuals and not in mass.<a id="FNanchor_2174" href="#Footnote_2174" class="fnanchor">[2174]</a> It was permissible for independent
communities and individuals to reject the offer of the franchise,<a id="FNanchor_2175" href="#Footnote_2175" class="fnanchor">[2175]</a>
whereas subjects and partial citizens were compelled to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
accept it.<a id="FNanchor_2176" href="#Footnote_2176" class="fnanchor">[2176]</a> From the facts here stated it will immediately
appear that after the people had acquired an unconditioned
right to extend the Roman franchise, they made little use of the
opportunity. The senate could well afford to concede to them
a power which they cherished a growing disinclination to use.
The expansion of the empire had at length so enhanced the
value of citizenship that the masses were unwilling except on
the rarest occasions to share its advantages with others.<a id="FNanchor_2177" href="#Footnote_2177" class="fnanchor">[2177]</a> Any
attempt, therefore, on the part of aliens to usurp the rights of
the city was resented. In 187 we find the senate appointing
the praetor Q. Terentius Culleo extraordinary commissioner
for determining by investigation who from the Latin towns had
recently usurped the citizenship, and for expelling from Rome
those found guilty of the offence.<a id="FNanchor_2178" href="#Footnote_2178" class="fnanchor">[2178]</a> Soon afterward the people
extended their power over such cases; in 177 a second expulsion
of the Latins was brought about by a consular law of C.
Claudius Pulcher.<a id="FNanchor_2179" href="#Footnote_2179" class="fnanchor">[2179]</a></p>

<p>The same spirit prompted the citizens to limit the political
rights of freedmen. There can be no doubt that early Rome
was as liberal in the treatment of this class as of aliens. From
earliest times they had a right to acquire land; and such proprietors
were undoubtedly enrolled in the tribes in which their
estates were situated.<a id="FNanchor_2180" href="#Footnote_2180" class="fnanchor">[2180]</a> From the beginning, however, custom
deprived them of the ius honorum<a id="FNanchor_2181" href="#Footnote_2181" class="fnanchor">[2181]</a> and of conubium. The
former they acquired along with the other plebeians, although
they were less readily admitted to the actual enjoyment of it;<a id="FNanchor_2182" href="#Footnote_2182" class="fnanchor">[2182]</a>
the latter they continued to lack.<a id="FNanchor_2183" href="#Footnote_2183" class="fnanchor">[2183]</a> They were exempt, too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
from ordinary military service.<a id="FNanchor_2184" href="#Footnote_2184" class="fnanchor">[2184]</a> In time their condition became
worse. C. Flaminius as censor in 220, in the interest of the rural
plebs,<a id="FNanchor_2185" href="#Footnote_2185" class="fnanchor">[2185]</a> began arbitrarily to assign all the libertini, whether they
had lands or not, to the four city tribes,<a id="FNanchor_2186" href="#Footnote_2186" class="fnanchor">[2186]</a> doubtless at the same
time to the supernumerary centuries of the comitia centuriata.<a id="FNanchor_2187" href="#Footnote_2187" class="fnanchor">[2187]</a>
But the sons of freedmen, themselves originally libertini,<a id="FNanchor_2188" href="#Footnote_2188" class="fnanchor">[2188]</a> came
in time to be looked upon as ingenui, with the same legal rights
as the old citizens. This change seems to have been effected
by the plebiscite of Q. Terentius Culleo, 189, for compelling
the censors to admit to the senate the sons of free parents—undoubtedly
those sons of libertini who were born after the
emancipation of the father.<a id="FNanchor_2189" href="#Footnote_2189" class="fnanchor">[2189]</a> The law must have involved the
principle of treating such persons as citizens optimo iure, and
have therefore required their enrolment in the country tribes,
provided they owned land. As the acquisition of full rights
came only with the death of the father, which made the son sui
iuris, the application of the principle must have required the
enrolment of the fathers along with the sons in the rural tribes;
in other words, it recognized as citizens optimo iure those
libertini who had children,<a id="FNanchor_2190" href="#Footnote_2190" class="fnanchor">[2190]</a> on the basis of the existing custom
of enlisting such persons in military service at crises.<a id="FNanchor_2191" href="#Footnote_2191" class="fnanchor">[2191]</a> The
political connections of the author of this statute leads us to
interpret it as a measure of the oligarchs for strengthening
their position by the votes of their dependents.<a id="FNanchor_2192" href="#Footnote_2192" class="fnanchor">[2192]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span></p>

<p>The increasing wealth and luxury of the age naturally gave
rise to sumptuary legislation; and the nobility could allow the
comitia to revel in this field, devoid as it was of political significance.
The first act, however, was to undo the Oppian law of
215<a id="FNanchor_2193" href="#Footnote_2193" class="fnanchor">[2193]</a> through the plebiscite of M. Valerius, 195, enacted probably
without a senatus consultum.<a id="FNanchor_2194" href="#Footnote_2194" class="fnanchor">[2194]</a> It was the senate which
initiated the tribunician statute of C. Orchius, 181, for limiting
the number of guests at banquets.<a id="FNanchor_2195" href="#Footnote_2195" class="fnanchor">[2195]</a> Cato opposed the enactment
of this measure on the ground that it was too easy,<a id="FNanchor_2196" href="#Footnote_2196" class="fnanchor">[2196]</a> but
twenty years afterward he protected it from abolition.<a id="FNanchor_2197" href="#Footnote_2197" class="fnanchor">[2197]</a> It was
reinforced in 161 by the lex cibaria of the consul C. Fannius
Strabo, which prescribed that ordinary meals should cost no
more than ten asses; on ten days of the month meals should
cost no more than thirty; and on the days of the ludi plebeii,
Saturnalia, and certain other great festivals, no more than a
hundred.<a id="FNanchor_2198" href="#Footnote_2198" class="fnanchor">[2198]</a> It also forbade the use of fowls excepting one unfattened
hen.<a id="FNanchor_2199" href="#Footnote_2199" class="fnanchor">[2199]</a> The lex Didia cibaria, pretorian or tribunician,
143, extended the application of the Fannian statute to all Italy,
and rendered liable to punishment not only the host who violated
the law but also the guests at such illegal repasts.<a id="FNanchor_2200" href="#Footnote_2200" class="fnanchor">[2200]</a></p>

<p>Closely akin to sumptuary laws are those for the regulation
of theatres and games. A plebiscite of Cn. Aufidius of unknown
date, possibly 170,<a id="FNanchor_2201" href="#Footnote_2201" class="fnanchor">[2201]</a> permitted the importation of wild
beasts from Africa for use in the circensian games. The statute
repealed a senatus consultum which had prohibited such importation.<a id="FNanchor_2202" href="#Footnote_2202" class="fnanchor">[2202]</a>
The arrangement of the social classes in the theatre
and at the games was determined partly by law. It was the
censors of 194, persuaded by Scipio Africanus the Elder,<a id="FNanchor_2203" href="#Footnote_2203" class="fnanchor">[2203]</a> who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
reserved the front seats for senators.<a id="FNanchor_2204" href="#Footnote_2204" class="fnanchor">[2204]</a> The assignment of fourteen
rows to the knights next to those of the senators was
effected by a plebiscite, possibly of 146, the author of which is
unknown.<a id="FNanchor_2205" href="#Footnote_2205" class="fnanchor">[2205]</a></p>

<p>For a long time the laws of the Twelve Tables administered
by the magistrates, more rarely by a special court created sometimes
by the senate but oftener and in better right during this
period by the people,<a id="FNanchor_2206" href="#Footnote_2206" class="fnanchor">[2206]</a> sufficed for controlling crime. But as
offences multiplied in consequence of the increasing complexity
of life, the people were called upon more and more frequently
to legislate on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_2207" href="#Footnote_2207" class="fnanchor">[2207]</a> One of the earliest may have been
the lex Fabia de plagiariis,<a id="FNanchor_2208" href="#Footnote_2208" class="fnanchor">[2208]</a> against the usurpation of ownership
over a Roman citizen without his consent or over his slave
without the consent of the owner.<a id="FNanchor_2209" href="#Footnote_2209" class="fnanchor">[2209]</a> The date of its origin is
unknown; but if Plautus<a id="FNanchor_2210" href="#Footnote_2210" class="fnanchor">[2210]</a> refers to it, as Voigt asserts,<a id="FNanchor_2211" href="#Footnote_2211" class="fnanchor">[2211]</a> it must
have been in force before 197. For this and other reasons
Voigt assigns it to Q. Fabius Verrucossus, consul in 209.<a id="FNanchor_2212" href="#Footnote_2212" class="fnanchor">[2212]</a>
Lange prefers Q. Fabius Labeo, consul in 183,<a id="FNanchor_2213" href="#Footnote_2213" class="fnanchor">[2213]</a> whereas
Mommsen places it after the Social war.<a id="FNanchor_2214" href="#Footnote_2214" class="fnanchor">[2214]</a> A lex Gabinia
threatened with scourging and death any one who induced the
people to gather in secret meetings. It seems to belong to the
time of the Bacchanalian trouble, 186,<a id="FNanchor_2215" href="#Footnote_2215" class="fnanchor">[2215]</a> and to have been designed
against religious associations of the kind; nevertheless the
nobility found in it a means of repressing popular agitation.</p>

<p>On the authority of a mutilated passage in the newly found
epitome of Livy an attempt has been made to assign to 149
the law of M. Scantinius (or Scatinius), probably tribune of the
plebs, for imposing a fine of ten thousand sesterces on any one
convicted of violating a man of free birth.<a id="FNanchor_2216" href="#Footnote_2216" class="fnanchor">[2216]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span></p>

<p>The statute which established the first standing court—quaestio
perpetua—was the lex Calpurnia de repetundis of the tribune
L. Calpurnius Piso Frugi, 149.<a id="FNanchor_2217" href="#Footnote_2217" class="fnanchor">[2217]</a> His motive was undoubtedly a
sincere desire to protect Italy<a id="FNanchor_2218" href="#Footnote_2218" class="fnanchor">[2218]</a> and the provinces from official
rapacity. The court was made up of a considerable number of
jurors drawn from the senate and presided over by a praetor,
who had hitherto exercised civil jurisdiction only. In fact a
trial for extortion was at first thought of as a civil suit for the
recovery of wealth illegally taken—a conception which determined
the organization of the Calpurnian quaestio. But from
time to time new standing courts were instituted each with cognizance
of a specified class of crimes, till before the end of the
republic they had taken upon themselves practically all criminal
jurisdiction, retaining little trace of their civil origin.<a id="FNanchor_2219" href="#Footnote_2219" class="fnanchor">[2219]</a> Between
149 and 141, for instance, was established a standing quaestio
for the trial of cases of murder.<a id="FNanchor_2220" href="#Footnote_2220" class="fnanchor">[2220]</a></p>

<p>It was in keeping with the oligarchic tendency of the age
that a consular law of M’. Acilius Glabrio, 191, gave the pontiffs
the function of determining which years should be intercalary
and of how many days such years should consist. Thus
these functionaries secured the means of bringing the solar and
civil years into accord; but they used their new power mostly
in the interests of their party, with the result that the confusion
in the calendar increased rather than lessened.<a id="FNanchor_2221" href="#Footnote_2221" class="fnanchor">[2221]</a> The nobles
made their greatest gain in the control of legislation and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
elections about the middle of the century through the statutes
of Aelius and Fufius, probably tribunes of the plebs. By granting
the patrician magistrates the obnuntiatio against the tribunes,
or perhaps by confirming the former in a usurped power of the
kind, it enabled the nobles to exercise a practical veto on tribunician
legislation, and may for that reason be looked upon as the
firmest support of the plutocracy.<a id="FNanchor_2222" href="#Footnote_2222" class="fnanchor">[2222]</a> An article of the statute forbade
the bringing of a rogation before the people in the interval
between the announcement and the holding of elective comitia.<a id="FNanchor_2223" href="#Footnote_2223" class="fnanchor">[2223]</a></p>

<p>Toward the close of the period a democratic movement preliminary
to the revolution began with the enactment of two important
ballot laws. The first was the plebiscite of Q. Gabinius,
139, whom the optimates took pleasure in representing as ignoble
and mean.<a id="FNanchor_2224" href="#Footnote_2224" class="fnanchor">[2224]</a> It introduced the ballot in elections with a view to
freeing the voter from the influence of the nobility; for many
of the poor were at this time falling into economic, and hence
political, dependence on the rich.<a id="FNanchor_2225" href="#Footnote_2225" class="fnanchor">[2225]</a> The other was the plebiscite
of L. Cassius Longinus Ravilla, 137, for extending the use of
the ballot to all trials before the people with the exception of
perduellio.<a id="FNanchor_2226" href="#Footnote_2226" class="fnanchor">[2226]</a> Cases coming under the law were those which involved
fines imposed by the tribes under aedilician or tribunician
presidency. Probably in the opinion of the author, a conscientious
noble,<a id="FNanchor_2227" href="#Footnote_2227" class="fnanchor">[2227]</a> cases of perduellio were too rare to need the change or
too solemn to admit of a disturbance of traditional usage. These
measures had little immediate effect, for the nobles were as
clever as the commons at exploiting the secret ballot for partisan
objects<a id="FNanchor_2228" href="#Footnote_2228" class="fnanchor">[2228]</a>; yet the principle, when carried to completion by the
supplementary laws on the subject in the years immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
following, contributed greatly to the success of the revolution.<a id="FNanchor_2229" href="#Footnote_2229" class="fnanchor">[2229]</a>
Not without significance for the general trend of affairs is the
circumstance that in these latter years of the completed plutocracy
two dispensations were granted P. Scipio Aemilianus from
laws which had been designed to secure it against the rise of
great personalities. In 148 when he offered himself for the
aedileship, being still too young for the consulship,<a id="FNanchor_2230" href="#Footnote_2230" class="fnanchor">[2230]</a> the people
insisted on electing him to the latter office. “When the consuls
showed them the law they became more importunate and urged
all the more, exclaiming that by the laws handed down from
Tullius and Romulus the people were judges of the elections,
and of the laws pertaining thereto they could set aside or confirm
whichever they pleased.<a id="FNanchor_2231" href="#Footnote_2231" class="fnanchor">[2231]</a> Finally one of the tribunes of
the people declared that he would take from the consuls the
power of holding an election unless they yielded to the people in
this matter. Then the senate allowed the tribunes to repeal this
law and after one year they reënacted it.”<a id="FNanchor_2232" href="#Footnote_2232" class="fnanchor">[2232]</a> From this event it
can be seen that when the tribunes and people were unitedly
determined upon a measure, they were irresistible. It is evident,
too, that in popular theory no laws could prevent the
citizens from having the magistrates whom they chose to elect.
Again in 135 a plebiscite, authorized by a senatus consultum,
granted more speedily on this occasion though doubtless with as
great regret, exempted him from the law which absolutely forbade
reëlection to the consulship.<a id="FNanchor_2233" href="#Footnote_2233" class="fnanchor">[2233]</a> It was equally ominous that
in the preceding year the proconsulship of M. Aemilius Lepidus
was abrogated, probably by an act of the comitia.<a id="FNanchor_2234" href="#Footnote_2234" class="fnanchor">[2234]</a></p>

<p>Another premonition of the revolution was the renewal of
agrarian agitation, with which in a varying degree some of the
more enlightened nobles sympathized. It began slowly to dawn
upon them that the economic ruin of the peasant class was endangering
the state—a feeling which found expression in the
agrarian rogation of C. Laelius, praetor in 145.<a id="FNanchor_2235" href="#Footnote_2235" class="fnanchor">[2235]</a> The measure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
must have been similar to the Licinian-Sextian law as it threatened
the interests of the rich.<a id="FNanchor_2236" href="#Footnote_2236" class="fnanchor">[2236]</a> When he saw that their opposition
would be such as to disturb the public peace, he dropped the
proposal. If he was in truth called Sapiens because of this
speedy retreat, the epithet was too easily earned. Reform,
while there was yet time, was blocked as much by the cowardice
of the well-minded as by the enormous selfishness of the majority
of nobles. It was in this time of extraordinary imperial
prosperity that, in the opinion of Polybius, the constitution was
successfully put to its severest test. “When these external
alarms are past, and the people are enjoying their good fortune
and the fruits of their victories, and, as usually happens, growing
corrupted by flattery and sloth, show a tendency to violence
and arrogance—it is in these circumstances more than ever
that the constitution is seen to possess within itself the power of
correcting abuses. For when any one of the three classes
becomes puffed up, and manifests an inclination to be contentious
and unduly encroaching, the mutual interdependence of
all the three, and the possibility of the pretensions of any one’s
being curbed and thwarted by the others, must plainly check
this tendency; and so the proper equilibrium is maintained by
the impulsiveness of the one part’s being checked by its fear of
the other.”<a id="FNanchor_2237" href="#Footnote_2237" class="fnanchor">[2237]</a> These words, which we may suppose to have been
written after the tribunate of Ti. Gracchus,<a id="FNanchor_2238" href="#Footnote_2238" class="fnanchor">[2238]</a> accurately describe
the interplay of constitutional forces in the period of the completed
plutocracy and of the incipient revolution. Controlled
in some instances by self-satisfaction and the spirit of repose
and in others by greed and arrogance, the dominant institutions
of government tended in the one case to sluggishness and decay,
in the other to violence; whereas the harmony of the constitution,
or its equivalent the soundness of Roman character, like a
central sun, held the various institutions in the main to their
respective orbits, compelling each to attend to its appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
function. No retrospect of the Gracchan troubles induced the
great historian to revise the view here expressed; for with his
boundless faith in Rome he could never doubt that her constitution
contained the cure of every evil which new conditions
should breed within the state.<a id="FNanchor_2239" href="#Footnote_2239" class="fnanchor">[2239]</a></p>

<h4>I. <i>The Gracchi</i><br />
134-122</h4>

<p>The work of agrarian reform, after the feeble attempt of
Laelius,<a id="FNanchor_2240" href="#Footnote_2240" class="fnanchor">[2240]</a> was taken up in a more determined spirit by Ti. Sempronius
Gracchus, who early in his tribunate, upon which he
entered December 10, 134, promulgated his famous lex agraria.
It was a repetition, with some modifications and additions, of
those articles of the Licinian-Sextian statute which related to
the same subject. The last instance of the prosecution of trespassers
against the earlier law given in our imperfect records
belongs to 193,<a id="FNanchor_2241" href="#Footnote_2241" class="fnanchor">[2241]</a> and it must still have been in force in 167 when
Cato<a id="FNanchor_2242" href="#Footnote_2242" class="fnanchor">[2242]</a> recited its terms in his “Oration in behalf of the Rhodians.”
Probably about the time of Flaminius the agrarian provisions
of this statute were renewed with the addition of articles,
(a) providing that a specified proportion of free laborers should
be employed on public lands held in possession. (b) requiring
holders to take an oath to obey the law. (c) increasing the
penalty for violations.<a id="FNanchor_2243" href="#Footnote_2243" class="fnanchor">[2243]</a></p>

<p>Tiberius had matured his plan before entering office. Assisted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
by experienced friends, among whom were P. Licinius Crassus,
P. Mucius Scaevola, the most eminent jurist of his generation,
consul designate for 133, and Appius Claudius Pulcher, his
father-in-law, he expressed the articles of his rogation in the
most careful terms and with especial regard for vested interests.<a id="FNanchor_2244" href="#Footnote_2244" class="fnanchor">[2244]</a>
Its chief provisions were—</p>

<p>(1) No one shall hold more than five hundred iugera of the
public land, excepting that in case the holder has sons he may
occupy an additional two hundred and fifty iugera for each of
two sons.<a id="FNanchor_2245" href="#Footnote_2245" class="fnanchor">[2245]</a></p>

<p>(2) The occupier shall receive compensation for improvements
on the lands which the law compels him to surrender.<a id="FNanchor_2246" href="#Footnote_2246" class="fnanchor">[2246]</a></p>

<p>(3) The five hundred to one thousand iugera retained by
the occupier shall be granted to him by the state in perpetuity
and free from all dues.<a id="FNanchor_2247" href="#Footnote_2247" class="fnanchor">[2247]</a></p>

<p>(4) The lands thus accruing to the state shall be divided
among the needy<a id="FNanchor_2248" href="#Footnote_2248" class="fnanchor">[2248]</a> in lots, the maximal size of which seems to
have been set at thirty iugera,<a id="FNanchor_2249" href="#Footnote_2249" class="fnanchor">[2249]</a> to be held not as private
property but as permanent, heritable leaseholds inalienable and
subject to a specified rent.<a id="FNanchor_2250" href="#Footnote_2250" class="fnanchor">[2250]</a> The Latins and Italians are to be
included among the beneficiaries of this provision.<a id="FNanchor_2251" href="#Footnote_2251" class="fnanchor">[2251]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span></p>

<p>(5) Certain specified parts of the public domain shall not be
subject to assignment—the same parts which are afterward
reserved from assignment by the agrarian law of 111:<a id="FNanchor_2252" href="#Footnote_2252" class="fnanchor">[2252]</a></p>

<p>a. Land granted by law or by a senatorial decree to a
colony, a municipium, or a Latin town, with the exception of
any tracts of such land which this law may expressly order to
be sold, assigned, or restored.<a id="FNanchor_2253" href="#Footnote_2253" class="fnanchor">[2253]</a> Public domain granted by a
lex or a senatus consultum can be withdrawn by the same, but
the modification of a treaty requires the consent of both
parties.<a id="FNanchor_2254" href="#Footnote_2254" class="fnanchor">[2254]</a></p>

<p>b. The trientabula—portions of public land granted by the
government for a quit rent to its creditors as security for any
part of a loan.<a id="FNanchor_2255" href="#Footnote_2255" class="fnanchor">[2255]</a></p>

<p>c. The ager compascuus—public land on which a specified
group of neighbors have a right to pasture free of charge ten
large domestic animals—cattle, horses, mules, and asses—and
a fixed number of small animals, unknown to us on account of a
lacuna in the inscription but most probably fifty.<a id="FNanchor_2256" href="#Footnote_2256" class="fnanchor">[2256]</a> As the unit
was doubtless the individual, much of the land of this description
must have remained undivided.<a id="FNanchor_2257" href="#Footnote_2257" class="fnanchor">[2257]</a></p>

<p>d. Public roads.<a id="FNanchor_2258" href="#Footnote_2258" class="fnanchor">[2258]</a></p>

<p>e. Other portions of the public domain specifically designated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
as exempt from distribution, including the Campanian
lands, which are leased out by the censors.<a id="FNanchor_2259" href="#Footnote_2259" class="fnanchor">[2259]</a></p>

<p>f. Certain pasture lands let out to any who wish to feed
their live stock thereon, who pay a tax (scriptura) for the
privilege.<a id="FNanchor_2260" href="#Footnote_2260" class="fnanchor">[2260]</a></p>

<p>(6) The distribution of the lands shall be effected by a standing
magistracy elected annually by the tribes<a id="FNanchor_2261" href="#Footnote_2261" class="fnanchor">[2261]</a>—the triumviri
agris dandis adsignandis.<a id="FNanchor_2262" href="#Footnote_2262" class="fnanchor">[2262]</a></p>

<p>(7) As all available public land is to be utilized in the
various ways described above, and as the holders of lands once
public are to be guaranteed in their possession, further occupation
of land is thereby precluded.<a id="FNanchor_2263" href="#Footnote_2263" class="fnanchor">[2263]</a></p>

<p>Afterward as Tiberius found it impossible to reconcile the
optimates to his measure, he withdrew the second article and
proposed to eject illegal holders without compensation.<a id="FNanchor_2264" href="#Footnote_2264" class="fnanchor">[2264]</a> When
the nobles induced Octavius, a colleague in the tribunate, to
veto the bill, Tiberius had him deposed by a vote of the tribes,
and then passed the agrarian law without further opposition,
unauthorized however by the senate.<a id="FNanchor_2265" href="#Footnote_2265" class="fnanchor">[2265]</a> The triumviri elected
to take charge of the work of distribution were the author of
the law, his brother Gaius, and his father-in-law Appius Claudius
Pulcher.<a id="FNanchor_2266" href="#Footnote_2266" class="fnanchor">[2266]</a> As the election of these persons was a violation of
the Licinian and Aebutian plebiscites,<a id="FNanchor_2267" href="#Footnote_2267" class="fnanchor">[2267]</a> a dispensation was probably
granted by vote of the people.<a id="FNanchor_2268" href="#Footnote_2268" class="fnanchor">[2268]</a> When the commission
found itself hampered by legal inability to distinguish between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
public and private land, Tiberius carried a second agrarian law
which invested the triumviri with the necessary judicial power
for determining what land was public and what private.<a id="FNanchor_2269" href="#Footnote_2269" class="fnanchor">[2269]</a> It was
by virtue of this second enactment that the word iudicandis was
introduced into the phrase descriptive of their functions—“iudicandis
adsignandis” or “dandis adsignandis iudicandis.”<a id="FNanchor_2270" href="#Footnote_2270" class="fnanchor">[2270]</a> In
the year 129, probably at the time of the election to this office,
Publius Scipio Aemilianus brought about the transfer of the
judicial function to the consuls. Appian,<a id="FNanchor_2271" href="#Footnote_2271" class="fnanchor">[2271]</a> our sole authority
for the latter act, speaks only of its discussion in the senate,
implying that this body rather than the people passed the resolution.
In that case the senate must have annulled the second
agrarian law on the ground that it was illegally passed; for in
no other way could it set aside a comitial statute.<a id="FNanchor_2272" href="#Footnote_2272" class="fnanchor">[2272]</a> Some land,
already delimited, may still have been subject to distribution;
but as the consuls avoided the disagreeable function received
from the commissioners, the work of assignment came speedily
to an end. The agrarian law of Ti. Gracchus fell thus into
disuse till it was revived by his brother.<a id="FNanchor_2273" href="#Footnote_2273" class="fnanchor">[2273]</a></p>

<p>The deposition of Octavius<a id="FNanchor_2274" href="#Footnote_2274" class="fnanchor">[2274]</a> requires especial consideration.
In 136 the proconsular imperium had been abrogated, probably
by a popular vote<a id="FNanchor_2275" href="#Footnote_2275" class="fnanchor">[2275]</a>; but no instance of the abrogation of an
actual magistracy had thus far occurred. Most scholars consider
the act unconstitutional.<a id="FNanchor_2276" href="#Footnote_2276" class="fnanchor">[2276]</a> It did indeed involve a sweeping
departure from long-established custom; but in favor of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
legality may be urged the fact that nearly all the powers ever
possessed by the assembly are known to have been acquired in
the way in which Tiberius was attempting to establish for it the
right to remove from office—by precedent rather than by law.
A statute of the Twelve Tables declared that whatever the people
voted last should be law and valid<a id="FNanchor_2277" href="#Footnote_2277" class="fnanchor">[2277]</a>; and through the ages
preceding the Gracchi they had often applied this principle to
the extension of their power at the expense of the senate and
magistrates. They were sovereign; and if they chose to introduce
the custom of deposing a magistrate whom they regarded
as the betrayer of their dearest interests, they had the legal
right. The wisdom of the proceeding may be questioned, but
he who has followed the history of the assemblies thus far must
regard the measure as merely one of the many steps by which
the people advanced toward the realization of their sovereignty.</p>

<p>Tiberius attempted to apply the same principle to securing
his election to the tribunate. His motive was not a purely
selfish desire to save his life; it required no superhuman wisdom
to discover that his downfall would mean the collapse of
the great reform on which he had set his heart. The continued
ascendancy of a popular champion necessarily involved the overthrow
of the senatorial government. This idea, which he now
clearly grasped, found expression in his new political platform,
(1) to shorten the period of military service, (2) by means of a
law of appeal to vest the supreme jurisdiction solely in the people,
so as to deprive the senate of its extra-constitutional judicial
power,<a id="FNanchor_2278" href="#Footnote_2278" class="fnanchor">[2278]</a> (3) to give the equites equal representation with the
senators in the juries, or possibly as Dio Cassius states, to
transfer the courts from the senate to the knights.<a id="FNanchor_2279" href="#Footnote_2279" class="fnanchor">[2279]</a> When
the day of election came, his peasant supporters were busy
with their harvests, and his platform did not strongly appeal
to the city plebs, on whom he had chiefly to rely for votes.
Had the people insisted, as they twice did in favor of Scipio,<a id="FNanchor_2280" href="#Footnote_2280" class="fnanchor">[2280]</a>
they would have prevailed either with or without an act of dispensation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
passed by the senate or by themselves<a id="FNanchor_2281" href="#Footnote_2281" class="fnanchor">[2281]</a>; but the weakness
of his supporters rather than any illegality in the proceeding
proved his ruin. To free the future reformer from this limitation,
however, a rogation of C. Papirius Carbo, tribune of the
plebs in 131, proposed that a tribune should be eligible to reëlection
as many times as he chose to offer himself as a candidate.
This rogation failed<a id="FNanchor_2282" href="#Footnote_2282" class="fnanchor">[2282]</a>; but before the tribunate of C. Gracchus,
123, “a certain law had already been enacted,” as Appian<a id="FNanchor_2283" href="#Footnote_2283" class="fnanchor">[2283]</a>
obscurely informs us, “that if a tribune should be wanting on
the announcement (of the votes), the people might elect one
from the whole body of citizens.” The statute, which Appian
has evidently failed to understand clearly, seems to have provided
that if the returns showed the election of only nine
tribunes from the candidates proposed, the people could proceed
to elect a tenth from the whole body of citizens, including
the existing tribunician college; or equivalently, if for the tenth
place the tribes cast a majority of votes for one who was not a
candidate, he would be considered legally elected.<a id="FNanchor_2284" href="#Footnote_2284" class="fnanchor">[2284]</a> The object
was to enable the people to continue in office an especially popular
tribune, and was therefore a notable stride in the direction
of monarchy.</p>

<p>Papirius was more successful with his lex tabellaria, which
extended the ballot to legislation, 131.<a id="FNanchor_2285" href="#Footnote_2285" class="fnanchor">[2285]</a> Trials of perduellio
alone retained the oral vote. Doubtless this improvement
greatly strengthened the rising popular party. A plebiscite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
passed about 129, requiring a knight on entering the senate to
sell his public horse, deprived the senators of their votes in
the eighteen centuries, and completed the separation of the governing
aristocracy from the commercial class begun by the
Claudian statute of 219.<a id="FNanchor_2286" href="#Footnote_2286" class="fnanchor">[2286]</a></p>

<p>At some unknown time before the tribunate of C. Gracchus a
plebiscite of M. Junius modified the lex Calpurnia concerning
extortion,<a id="FNanchor_2287" href="#Footnote_2287" class="fnanchor">[2287]</a> in what way we are not informed. The act is with a
high degree of probability attributed to M. Junius Pennus, tribune
of the plebs in 126.<a id="FNanchor_2288" href="#Footnote_2288" class="fnanchor">[2288]</a> If the Junian lex repetundarum was
indeed his work, it could have been dictated by no sympathy
with the unprivileged classes, for it was this Junius whose
plebiscite ordered the expulsion of all aliens from Rome—a
measure which Cicero condemns as inhuman.<a id="FNanchor_2289" href="#Footnote_2289" class="fnanchor">[2289]</a> The act last
mentioned was the response of the senate and rabble to the
effort of the more enlightened Romans to grant the citizenship
to the Latins and Italians. The new idea was embodied in a
rogation of M. Fulvius Flaccus, consul in 125, which offered the
citizenship, or as an alternative the right of appeal, to the Italians,
with the purpose of buying off their opposition to the
Sempronian agrarian law; but the measure was so vehemently
opposed in the senate that the author withdrew it.<a id="FNanchor_2290" href="#Footnote_2290" class="fnanchor">[2290]</a> The idea
however lived in the minds of the reformers till it was finally
realized.</p>

<p>Ten years after the tribunate of Ti. Gracchus his brother
Gaius entered upon the same office. Since the beginning of
the decennium the leaders of the popular party had made various<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
proposals but had accomplished little. The agrarian law
was still nominally in force, though its execution was effectually
blocked. The plan of extending the franchise had found its
most bitter opponents in the men of the street, on whom the
tribunes had chiefly to depend. The ballot in legislation, the
possibility of continuous reëlection to the tribunate, and the increase
of discontent with the plutocracy were the only gains.
Extraordinary progress was now to be made under the leadership
of a great creative statesman. The chronological succession
of his comitial enactments cannot be determined with
absolute certainty. We do not in every instance know whether
a given proposal was carried in his first or second year. This
much, however, is clear, that most of his measures belong to 123
and to the early part of 122. The execution of the laws, including
the seventy days’ journey to Carthage,<a id="FNanchor_2291" href="#Footnote_2291" class="fnanchor">[2291]</a> consumed much
of the second year, and after his defeat for the third term—about
July, 122—he carried no more plebiscites.<a id="FNanchor_2292" href="#Footnote_2292" class="fnanchor">[2292]</a> Among his
first thoughts was that of strengthening the legality of the
deposition of Octavius<a id="FNanchor_2293" href="#Footnote_2293" class="fnanchor">[2293]</a> by a rogation which provided that a
person so deposed should thereby be debarred forever from
office. He probably meant it more as an enunciation of a principle
than as a legislative project. The measure was never
offered to vote, but was withdrawn, we are told, at the request
of his mother.<a id="FNanchor_2294" href="#Footnote_2294" class="fnanchor">[2294]</a> Far more serious, and of lasting importance,
was his lex de provocatione, which, carrying into effect the idea
of his brother,<a id="FNanchor_2295" href="#Footnote_2295" class="fnanchor">[2295]</a> forbade the establishment of a special court or
the placing of the state under martial law without an act of the
people.<a id="FNanchor_2296" href="#Footnote_2296" class="fnanchor">[2296]</a> Further judicial legislation was postponed in the
interest of more pressing matters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span></p>

<p>While colonization and the assignment of land individually to
citizens, which Gaius planned on an extensive scale, as will soon
be noticed, were to provide for the agricultural population at the
expense of the state, and while the nobles and knights continued
to reap an unfailing harvest of wealth in the administration of
the provinces, the democratic reformer could think it only just
and expedient to subsidize the populace of the capital. The
artificial growth of Rome as a political centre, with no sound
economic basis but with a most unfavorable geographical situation,
rendered the problem of living difficult for the masses even
in time of prosperity; and recently circumstances had so diminished
the grain supply that relief from the government seemed
the only resource against threatening famine.<a id="FNanchor_2297" href="#Footnote_2297" class="fnanchor">[2297]</a> Before the time
of the Gracchi on occasions of especial scarcity or of especial
plenty the state had sold grain at a reduced rate; and the
aediles, we know not how often, had made similar reductions at
their own expense.<a id="FNanchor_2298" href="#Footnote_2298" class="fnanchor">[2298]</a> There can be no doubt, too, that individual
nobles in a private capacity often distributed free or cheap grain
among the poor to secure their support in elections. Attached
by such means to the nobles and the senate, the rabble had been
in the main conservative. There was a certain degree of justice
in giving the populace a share in the profits of empire and some
wisdom in substituting system for the existing irregularity. A
political result, we may also say aim, of the frumentarian
plebiscite of Gaius was to disattach the city populace from its
conservative moorings and to enlist it in the service of reform.
His measure, the first frumentarian law in Roman history, provided
for the monthly sale to every citizen who applied for it—practically
to those only who resided in or near Rome—of a
fixed number of modii of wheat at six and a third asses a modius,<a id="FNanchor_2299" href="#Footnote_2299" class="fnanchor">[2299]</a>
which was probably about half the average market price. The
law won for him the good will of the populace,<a id="FNanchor_2300" href="#Footnote_2300" class="fnanchor">[2300]</a> but his opponents
complained that it depleted the treasury and excited the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
mob to seditions.<a id="FNanchor_2301" href="#Footnote_2301" class="fnanchor">[2301]</a> It set an example for further reductions at
the expense of the state. Hence notwithstanding some good
features the effect of the law was pernicious, as it tended to
increase the number of idlers, to make the populace improvident,
and to encourage demagogism. It must be said, on
the other hand, that had Gaius lived to carry out his wide
scheme of colonization, he would have so relieved the capital
of its semi-pauper population as to render frumentations unnecessary,
whereupon the law would naturally have been
repealed.<a id="FNanchor_2302" href="#Footnote_2302" class="fnanchor">[2302]</a></p>

<p>After providing in the frumentarian act an expedient which,
we may believe, he looked upon as temporary, he resumed the
work of construction<a id="FNanchor_2303" href="#Footnote_2303" class="fnanchor">[2303]</a> by reviving his brother’s agrarian law.<a id="FNanchor_2304" href="#Footnote_2304" class="fnanchor">[2304]</a>
The continuance of the assignations as long as there remained
any public land that could be distributed was a most essential
element of his plan. Among the articles retained were those
which subjected the holders of assigned lots to a tax<a id="FNanchor_2305" href="#Footnote_2305" class="fnanchor">[2305]</a> and exempted
from distribution the Campanian territory not set apart
for his colony at Capua,<a id="FNanchor_2306" href="#Footnote_2306" class="fnanchor">[2306]</a> as well as various other lands excepted
both by the agrarian law of Tiberius and by that of 111.<a id="FNanchor_2307" href="#Footnote_2307" class="fnanchor">[2307]</a> Doubtless
it also reinvested the three commissioners with judicial
power, without which they could accomplish nothing. Through
this agrarian law, or possibly through a subsequent lex viaria,
the triumviri were empowered to build roads for the accommodation
of the new peasantry.<a id="FNanchor_2308" href="#Footnote_2308" class="fnanchor">[2308]</a> Though introducing no new
principle,<a id="FNanchor_2309" href="#Footnote_2309" class="fnanchor">[2309]</a> his lex agraria was not a simple reaffirmation of his
brother’s law with amendments and additions; but “a comprehensive
statute, so completely covering the ground of the earlier
Sempronian law that later legislation cites the law of Gaius, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
that of Tiberius Gracchus, as the authority for the regulations
which had revolutionized the tenure of the public land.”<a id="FNanchor_2310" href="#Footnote_2310" class="fnanchor">[2310]</a></p>

<p>These measures were passed before the tribunician elections
of the year,<a id="FNanchor_2311" href="#Footnote_2311" class="fnanchor">[2311]</a> which took place as usual in midsummer.<a id="FNanchor_2312" href="#Footnote_2312" class="fnanchor">[2312]</a> It was
his frumentarian law, together with the hope aroused by the long
array of promulgated measures, which secured his reëlection.
Soon afterward, though still in 123, he brought before the
comitia a rogation concerning the qualification of iudices. As
the quaestiones extraordinariae from the earliest times were
made up of senators, it was natural that the standing courts also
from the time of their institution should be similarly composed.<a id="FNanchor_2313" href="#Footnote_2313" class="fnanchor">[2313]</a>
Under such conditions the judicial authority afforded no efficient
check upon maladministration; and this immunity from
the law, together with the temptations to the misuse of power
especially in provincial commands, tended in the course of generations
to make of the senate, with individual exceptions, a class
of grand criminals. To remedy this evil and at the same time
to remove from the senate the strongest foundation of its political
power,<a id="FNanchor_2314" href="#Footnote_2314" class="fnanchor">[2314]</a> Ti. Sempronius Gracchus had proposed his rogatio
iudiciaria either for transferring the courts entirely to the
knights, or more probably for making up the juries of an equal
number of senators and knights.<a id="FNanchor_2315" href="#Footnote_2315" class="fnanchor">[2315]</a> It failed to become a law;
but Gaius now took up the matter, and after experimenting unsuccessfully
with one or two projects,<a id="FNanchor_2316" href="#Footnote_2316" class="fnanchor">[2316]</a> he finally, 122, carried a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
plebiscite which substituted knights for senators in the alba
iudicum,<a id="FNanchor_2317" href="#Footnote_2317" class="fnanchor">[2317]</a> from which not only standing courts but also special
commissions were to be filled.<a id="FNanchor_2318" href="#Footnote_2318" class="fnanchor">[2318]</a> It is uncertain whether mention
was made of equites or whether the result was reached merely
by exclusion and definition. There can be no doubt that the
qualifications were identical with those described in the extant
lex repetundarum,<a id="FNanchor_2319" href="#Footnote_2319" class="fnanchor">[2319]</a> attributed by scholars to M’. Acilius Glabrio,
a colleague of Gaius, and adopted accordingly soon after the
Sempronian judiciary law. The terms of the Acilian statute excluded
tribunes of the plebs, quaestors, tresviri capitales, military
tribunes of the first four legions, tresviri for assigning lands,
persons who had fought in the arena for pay or had been
condemned by a quaestio or by the people. It excluded further
all under thirty or over sixty years of age, and all who had their
domicile more than a mile from Rome, the fathers, brothers,
and sons of those who held the offices above enumerated,
senators, and their fathers, brothers and sons, as well as persons
living beyond the sea. A part of the statute missing from the
inscription may have contained a minimal property qualification,
which could have been no other than four hundred thousand
sesterces; or it may have restricted jury service to those who
“possess a public horse.”<a id="FNanchor_2320" href="#Footnote_2320" class="fnanchor">[2320]</a> According to Plutarch Gaius was
allowed the privilege of selecting the jurors. Had he remained
in power and continued in this function, he doubtless could have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
compelled the courts of his choosing to do justice. But the privilege
seems to have been restricted to the first list; thereafter, as
provided by the lex repetundarum of Acilius the praetor qui inter
peregrinos ius dicit was to attend to the matter.<a id="FNanchor_2321" href="#Footnote_2321" class="fnanchor">[2321]</a> The relation between
the Sempronian lex iudiciaria and the lex Acilia repetundarum
has not been precisely determined.<a id="FNanchor_2322" href="#Footnote_2322" class="fnanchor">[2322]</a> If the Sempronian
statute preceded the Acilian,<a id="FNanchor_2323" href="#Footnote_2323" class="fnanchor">[2323]</a> as is not unlikely, it was the intention
of Gaius to pass a general law regarding the qualifications and
mode of appointment of jurors, to be superseded in large part
by a succession of laws, which dealing with individual courts,
should regulate the qualification and appointment of their several
juries as well as the procedure and the penalties. This policy
indicates a conviction that he could give the reformed judicial
system greater stability by making the separate laws here referred
to entirely independent of his original lex iudiciaria.<a id="FNanchor_2324" href="#Footnote_2324" class="fnanchor">[2324]</a></p>

<p>The lex Acilia, described above as a plebiscite of M’. Acilius
Glabrio, colleague of C. Gracchus in 122,<a id="FNanchor_2325" href="#Footnote_2325" class="fnanchor">[2325]</a> took the place of the
lex Iunia of 126,<a id="FNanchor_2326" href="#Footnote_2326" class="fnanchor">[2326]</a> and is to be identified with a lex repetundarum
extensive fragments of which are preserved in an
inscription.<a id="FNanchor_2327" href="#Footnote_2327" class="fnanchor">[2327]</a> Whereas earlier laws on the subject rendered
governors of provinces, and perhaps administrative officers in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
Italy, alone liable to punishment, the Acilian statute includes magistrates
and senators and the sons of both as well as the holders
of promagisterial imperium.<a id="FNanchor_2328" href="#Footnote_2328" class="fnanchor">[2328]</a> The crime consists in taking in any
one year from those whom the law is designed to protect—from
the allies, Latins, provincials, and exterior nations under
the sway or in the friendship of the Roman people<a id="FNanchor_2329" href="#Footnote_2329" class="fnanchor">[2329]</a>—by
gift, seizure, compulsion, or other illegal means money or
property exceeding a specified sum, which a lacuna in the inscription
leaves unknown, but which is supposed to be four
thousand sesterces.<a id="FNanchor_2330" href="#Footnote_2330" class="fnanchor">[2330]</a> Holders of magistracies and imperia cannot
be brought to trial for the crime till after the expiration
of their terms,<a id="FNanchor_2331" href="#Footnote_2331" class="fnanchor">[2331]</a> on the general principle which exempts from
prosecution those who are engaged in the service of the
state.<a id="FNanchor_2332" href="#Footnote_2332" class="fnanchor">[2332]</a> The praetor qui inter peregrinos ius dicit within ten
days after the passage of the statute, and in future within ten
days after entering upon his office, is to choose for this court
four hundred and fifty persons with the qualifications for jury
service described above in connection with the Sempronian
judiciary law. From this group the accused is to reject under
oath his kinsmen within a specified degree and his sodales. The
accuser is to draw from the remainder a hundred persons, taking
oath that he has chosen no kinsman within a specified
degree or sodalis. The accused rejects fifty of the hundred,
and the remaining fifty constitute the jury for trying the
case.<a id="FNanchor_2333" href="#Footnote_2333" class="fnanchor">[2333]</a> The rules of procedure in the trial and the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
liability of the accused in the event of conviction are given.
The accuser, if an alien, is granted as a reward for a successful
prosecution the Roman citizenship for himself and his born
sons and grandsons. If he is a Latin and does not want the
citizenship, he is given instead the right of appeal.<a id="FNanchor_2334" href="#Footnote_2334" class="fnanchor">[2334]</a> Probably
the law contained provisions for the punishment of corruption
in the patrons of the accusers and in the praetor and jurors.<a id="FNanchor_2335" href="#Footnote_2335" class="fnanchor">[2335]</a></p>

<p>It is certain that Gaius carried a law also for reconstituting
the quaestio inter sicarios et veneficos,<a id="FNanchor_2336" href="#Footnote_2336" class="fnanchor">[2336]</a> which had originally
been established shortly before 141.<a id="FNanchor_2337" href="#Footnote_2337" class="fnanchor">[2337]</a> The Sempronian law on
this subject contained a provision for the punishment of bribery
or conspiracy committed in trials of the kind. The article
referred to included the words “Ne quis iudicio circumveniretur,”<a id="FNanchor_2338" href="#Footnote_2338" class="fnanchor">[2338]</a>
a principle repeated as “Qui coisset, quo quis condemnaretur”<a id="FNanchor_2339" href="#Footnote_2339" class="fnanchor">[2339]</a>
in the corresponding article of the Cornelian law
which superseded the Sempronian. There was no quaestio for
dealing especially with judicial corruption and conspiracy, but
the accused was brought to trial before the very court in relation
to which his crime was alleged to have been committed.<a id="FNanchor_2340" href="#Footnote_2340" class="fnanchor">[2340]</a> The
provision was directed against the accuser, against magistrates
and senators who presided over such courts, and presumably
against equestrian jurors who accepted bribes.<a id="FNanchor_2341" href="#Footnote_2341" class="fnanchor">[2341]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span></p>

<p>We have in an inscription the concluding articles of a
criminal law<a id="FNanchor_2342" href="#Footnote_2342" class="fnanchor">[2342]</a> of this period. It is on a bronze tablet found on
the site of the ancient Italian city Bantia, and is called the
Latin Lex Bantina to distinguish it from another lex in
Oscan on the opposite face.<a id="FNanchor_2343" href="#Footnote_2343" class="fnanchor">[2343]</a> A reference to the triumviri
agris dandis adsignandis, who seem to have been those elected
under the Sempronian agrarian law, places the document between
133 and 118. It is concerned with a quaestio.<a id="FNanchor_2344" href="#Footnote_2344" class="fnanchor">[2344]</a> An
attempt has been made to identify it with the lex Iunia
repetundarum and to assign it accordingly to 126.<a id="FNanchor_2345" href="#Footnote_2345" class="fnanchor">[2345]</a> The circumstance,
however, that it was passed without the authorization
of the senate, and that its whole spirit is anti-senatorial,
would lead us rather to the conclusion that it was the work of
C. Gracchus at the time of his most bitter struggle with the
optimates yet before he had lost control of the comitia. The
fragment contains no more than the sanctio—provisions for
enforcement of the statute. The beginning of the first extant
article is lost, but it must have described the class of offenders
to which the article applies, and the nature of the offence. It
speaks merely of disabilities imposed on the offender, among
which are the following: he must not address the senate or
vote in a public trial (poplico ioudicio) or in comitia or receive
or give testimony in court or wear the praetexta and soleae in
public or be chosen into the senate or remain in it if already a
member. The second article provides that if a tribune of the
plebs, a quaestor, a triumvir capitalis, a triumvir for assigning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
lands, or a index appointed under the law itself, or a senator
shall with knowledge and malice prepense violate the law or
hinder its operation, he shall be liable to a fine, the amount of
which a lacuna in the text leaves unknown. The third article
provides that a consul, praetor, aedile, tribune of the plebs,
quaestor, triumvir capitalis, or triumvir for the assignment of
lands now in office shall, within the next five days after ascertaining
that the law has been enacted, swear in the manner described
below: also that the dictator, consul, praetor, master of horse,
censor, aedile, and other officials as above enumerated, and the
index appointed under this law shall in future take the oath
within five days after entering upon their magistracies or imperia.
They shall give oath to the urban quaestor publicly in
front of the temple of Castor, swearing by Jupiter and the di
Penates that they will do as the law requires and will not with
knowledge and malice prepense violate the law or by intercession
or otherwise hinder its administration. He who fails to
swear shall not be candidate for a magistracy or imperium, or
manage or retain either, or address the senate or be chosen into
it; and the quaestor shall keep a list of those who have taken
the oath. The fourth article provides that whoever is or shall
be a senator, or shall have the right of addressing the senate
after this law has been passed, shall within the next ten days
after ascertaining the fact of its enactment take an oath like
that described in article 3. The penalty for failure to swear
is not mentioned in the extant fragment, but must at the mildest
have been expulsion from the senate.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the transfer of the iudicia from the
senators to the knights is the statute of Gaius concerning the
taxation of Asia. It ordered the censors to let out the taxes of
this province to the highest bidders; and it limited the right of
the senate to lessen the sum agreed upon.<a id="FNanchor_2346" href="#Footnote_2346" class="fnanchor">[2346]</a> Under such an
arrangement, however, no sufficient guarantee could be provided
for the security of the provincials from publican<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
exactions.<a id="FNanchor_2347" href="#Footnote_2347" class="fnanchor">[2347]</a> The political result of this legislation in favor of the
knights was to invest them not only with an important share
in the administration, but through the courts with a superiority
even over the senate.<a id="FNanchor_2348" href="#Footnote_2348" class="fnanchor">[2348]</a> The opposition of the poorer class to
the aristocracy could never be otherwise than uncertain and
fitful; but the knights with their immense wealth and their
efficient organization were to be henceforth an ever present
rival of the senate. The author of the law had given the state
a double head,<a id="FNanchor_2349" href="#Footnote_2349" class="fnanchor">[2349]</a> which was to prove the source of civil discord;
or nearly in his own words, he had thrust into the body of the
senate a sword which nothing could withdraw.<a id="FNanchor_2350" href="#Footnote_2350" class="fnanchor">[2350]</a> For a few
months their benefactor may have cherished the delusion that
he could depend upon their grateful support; he lived to discover
that they cared not for him or his reforms but only for
their immediate interests. In his work of construction the
statesman found them slightly more serviceable than the proletariate.</p>

<p>The right which the senate had hitherto possessed of assigning
the provinces to the magistrates and promagistrates according
to its pleasure gave a great opportunity for favoritism and
partisanship; it could thwart the will of the people by assigning
a popular consul to an insignificant province. To deprive
the senate of a power which could be so easily perverted to
wrong use, C. Gracchus proposed and carried an act which
ordered the senate before the election to name the provinces
that were to be consular.<a id="FNanchor_2351" href="#Footnote_2351" class="fnanchor">[2351]</a> An article forbade tribunician intercession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
against such action of the senate.<a id="FNanchor_2352" href="#Footnote_2352" class="fnanchor">[2352]</a> Far from improving
the administration, however, this statute tended to foster that routine
which was one of the most marked defects of oligarchic rule.<a id="FNanchor_2353" href="#Footnote_2353" class="fnanchor">[2353]</a></p>

<p>As under the government of the nobility military affairs were
in the hands of the magistrates and senate, this field was closed
to comitial legislation.<a id="FNanchor_2354" href="#Footnote_2354" class="fnanchor">[2354]</a> One of the most notable indications of
growing democracy was the project of Ti. Gracchus, 133, for
shortening the period of service. It was not brought to vote;<a id="FNanchor_2355" href="#Footnote_2355" class="fnanchor">[2355]</a>
but his brother Gaius succeeded in passing a plebiscite, 123,
which ordered that the state should bear the cost of clothing
soldiers, and forbade the enlistment of boys before the close of
their seventeenth year.<a id="FNanchor_2356" href="#Footnote_2356" class="fnanchor">[2356]</a> The pay of the soldiers, which since the
war with Hannibal had remained five and a third asses a day,
had under new conditions become wholly inadequate; and certainly
insistence on the legal age limitation was prudent as well
as humane. There is no ground, then, for imagining with
Diodorus<a id="FNanchor_2357" href="#Footnote_2357" class="fnanchor">[2357]</a> that in this salutary measure Gaius was catering for
the support of the soldiers by inciting them to disobedience and
lawlessness.</p>

<p>His greatest constructive work he aimed to achieve through
colonization and through the extension of the franchise. His
colonial law, 123, proposed to establish many settlements in
Italy,<a id="FNanchor_2358" href="#Footnote_2358" class="fnanchor">[2358]</a> two of which at least should be made up of men of the
best character, not the neediest but traders and workmen of
moderate means.<a id="FNanchor_2359" href="#Footnote_2359" class="fnanchor">[2359]</a> The two actually founded were Scolacium
and Neptunia,<a id="FNanchor_2360" href="#Footnote_2360" class="fnanchor">[2360]</a> both in situations favorable for commerce.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
Several other settlements in Italy are attributed to his colonial
or agrarian statute.<a id="FNanchor_2361" href="#Footnote_2361" class="fnanchor">[2361]</a> As his colonies were exclusively citizen,<a id="FNanchor_2362" href="#Footnote_2362" class="fnanchor">[2362]</a>
if any aliens took part, they must by virtue of the colonial law
have obtained the Roman rights. The statute of his colleague
Rubrius the same year (123) provided for the founding of Junonia
on the site of Carthage.<a id="FNanchor_2363" href="#Footnote_2363" class="fnanchor">[2363]</a> But the most liberal and statesmanlike
measure was reserved for his second tribunate, 122.
It was a proposal to grant full citizenship to the Latins and the
ius Latii to the remaining allies.<a id="FNanchor_2364" href="#Footnote_2364" class="fnanchor">[2364]</a> The rejection of the bill by a
popular vote proved the leader far too liberal and too progressive
for his supporters. Deceived by the spurious proposals of
M. Livius Drusus,<a id="FNanchor_2365" href="#Footnote_2365" class="fnanchor">[2365]</a> a colleague of Gaius, for the founding of
twelve colonies, the members of which were to hold their lots by
fee simple and consequently exempt from rents, and for depriving
the Roman magistrates of the right to inflict corporal punishment
on Latins even when in military service under their
commands,<a id="FNanchor_2366" href="#Footnote_2366" class="fnanchor">[2366]</a> the populace, readily accepting the new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
proposals,<a id="FNanchor_2367" href="#Footnote_2367" class="fnanchor">[2367]</a> turned against their true champion, and defeated him in the
election for the tribunate for the ensuing year.<a id="FNanchor_2368" href="#Footnote_2368" class="fnanchor">[2368]</a> It was probably
the same measure of Gaius for extending the citizenship which
alienated from him the equites, who in every crisis pursued their
own selfish ends.<a id="FNanchor_2369" href="#Footnote_2369" class="fnanchor">[2369]</a> In the ensuing struggle between the senate
and Gaius they took the side of the former.<a id="FNanchor_2370" href="#Footnote_2370" class="fnanchor">[2370]</a></p>

<p>In the tribunate of Gaius Gracchus the life of the comitia
reached the highest point of intensity. The two years of his
administration afford evidence of what the assembly could accomplish
when directed by the personality of a great statesman.<a id="FNanchor_2371" href="#Footnote_2371" class="fnanchor">[2371]</a>
The sum total of the measures adopted should be estimated not
as a completed work, but as a foundation to be strengthened at
defective points and to be built upon till the whole structure of
the state and empire should be reconstituted and freshly vitalized.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
These results might have been achieved, had Gaius lived
out his natural life and retained the support of the populace and
the knights.<a id="FNanchor_2372" href="#Footnote_2372" class="fnanchor">[2372]</a> His failure proved the comitia a weak, unsafe
instrument for constructive statesmanship.</p>

<h4>II. <i>The Aristocratic Reaction and the Popular Recovery</i><br />
122-103</h4>

<p>The optimates waited only for the expiration of the tribunate
of Gaius Gracchus to begin undoing his work, and they found
the comitia ready to aid in the demolition. In 121 a plebiscite
of M. Minucius Rufus repealed the Rubrian law for the colonization
of Junonia (Carthage).<a id="FNanchor_2373" href="#Footnote_2373" class="fnanchor">[2373]</a> Soon afterward, certainly not
later than 118, a plebiscite, whose author is unknown, permitted
the beneficiaries of the Sempronian agrarian laws to sell the
lots they had received.<a id="FNanchor_2374" href="#Footnote_2374" class="fnanchor">[2374]</a> This enactment was followed in 118
by a plebiscite which Appian<a id="FNanchor_2375" href="#Footnote_2375" class="fnanchor">[2375]</a> assigns to Spurius Borius (?), a
name not otherwise known.<a id="FNanchor_2376" href="#Footnote_2376" class="fnanchor">[2376]</a> It put an end to the distributions,
and must therefore have abolished the agrarian triumvirate.
The same law confirmed all holders of the ager publicus
in their possession, without converting any of this land into
private property, and it continued the imposition of rents. We
may assume that the lands here referred to included those recently
distributed in small lots as well as those retained by the
occupiers. Lastly it enacted that the revenues accruing from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
the rents should be used for distributions—probably of cheap
grain.<a id="FNanchor_2377" href="#Footnote_2377" class="fnanchor">[2377]</a> In 111 another tribune, whom Cicero<a id="FNanchor_2378" href="#Footnote_2378" class="fnanchor">[2378]</a> names Sp. Thorius,
through a law which has partially survived in an inscription,
aimed to settle definitely and for all time in the interest
of the nobles the questions raised by the Sempronian agrarian
legislation.</p>

<p>I. This epigraphic lex agraria converts into private property
the following classes of lands.<a id="FNanchor_2379" href="#Footnote_2379" class="fnanchor">[2379]</a></p>

<p>(1) Land assigned to a colony or in any way made public,
and afterward restored to the original owners (domneis). It is
to be private optuma lege.<a id="FNanchor_2380" href="#Footnote_2380" class="fnanchor">[2380]</a></p>

<p>(2) Land assigned to a colony and afterward restored to its
former occupier (veteri possessori).<a id="FNanchor_2381" href="#Footnote_2381" class="fnanchor">[2381]</a></p>

<p>(3) Land within the legal limit (of five hundred iugera) left
to the occupier by the three commissioners.<a id="FNanchor_2382" href="#Footnote_2382" class="fnanchor">[2382]</a></p>

<p>(4) Land assigned after 133 to colonies of Roman citizens.<a id="FNanchor_2383" href="#Footnote_2383" class="fnanchor">[2383]</a></p>

<p>(5) Land given and assigned by the three commissioners after
133.<a id="FNanchor_2384" href="#Footnote_2384" class="fnanchor">[2384]</a></p>

<p>(6) Land which has been occupied after 133 (not assigned
by the commissioners) to the extent of not more than thirty
iugera to the occupier.<a id="FNanchor_2385" href="#Footnote_2385" class="fnanchor">[2385]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span></p>

<p>(7) Land which by the provision of this law is to be sold,
granted, or restored.<a id="FNanchor_2386" href="#Footnote_2386" class="fnanchor">[2386]</a></p>

<p>All the lands above enumerated are declared private and free
from vectigal and scriptura.<a id="FNanchor_2387" href="#Footnote_2387" class="fnanchor">[2387]</a></p>

<p>II. The lands which the law declares public are those reserved
from distribution by the law of Ti. Gracchus.<a id="FNanchor_2388" href="#Footnote_2388" class="fnanchor">[2388]</a> It retains further
as public all lands along public roads which have been granted
by the commissioners on condition that the recipients (viasieis
vicaneis) in return for the use of the land undertake the duty of
keeping the roads in repair. Though heritable and alienable,
they remain subject to the burden here described.<a id="FNanchor_2389" href="#Footnote_2389" class="fnanchor">[2389]</a></p>

<p>III. In the regulation of the agrarian conditions of Africa the
statute deals with three kinds of land, (1) private ex iure quiritium,<a id="FNanchor_2390" href="#Footnote_2390" class="fnanchor">[2390]</a>
(2) private ex iure peregrino,<a id="FNanchor_2391" href="#Footnote_2391" class="fnanchor">[2391]</a> (3) public domain of the
Roman people of various sub-classes.<a id="FNanchor_2392" href="#Footnote_2392" class="fnanchor">[2392]</a> Lastly the statute aims
to settle the status of the lands of Corinth.<a id="FNanchor_2393" href="#Footnote_2393" class="fnanchor">[2393]</a> As regards the
Latins and aliens, whatever has already been permitted them
by treaty or law is allowed them by this statute, provided the
same thing is allowed a Roman citizen; but it is forbidden
them if forbidden a citizen. Rights granted the citizens which
up to this time are not enjoyed by aliens are not by this law
communicated to aliens.<a id="FNanchor_2394" href="#Footnote_2394" class="fnanchor">[2394]</a></p>

<p>Through this series of reactionary laws, from the Minucian
(121) to the Thorian (111), the optimates succeeded in nullifying
the good results of the Sempronian agrarian reforms. It
was while the Minucian rogation<a id="FNanchor_2395" href="#Footnote_2395" class="fnanchor">[2395]</a> was under discussion that
the senate took advantage of a disturbance in the concilium to
arm the consul Opimius with absolute power for putting down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
C. Gracchus and his followers.<a id="FNanchor_2396" href="#Footnote_2396" class="fnanchor">[2396]</a> The failure of an attempt in
the following year (120) to call Opimius to account for these
proceedings established the right of the senate to the appointment
of special commissions and to the decretum ultimum<a id="FNanchor_2397" href="#Footnote_2397" class="fnanchor">[2397]</a>—a
right on which the optimates continued to insist to the end of
the republic. Through the plebiscite of L. Calpurnius Bestia
(also 120)<a id="FNanchor_2398" href="#Footnote_2398" class="fnanchor">[2398]</a> they put the stamp of legitimacy upon the murder
of the followers of Ti. Gracchus by recalling from exile P.
Popillius Laenas, who as consul in 132 and head of a special
court was chiefly responsible for that judicial crime.<a id="FNanchor_2399" href="#Footnote_2399" class="fnanchor">[2399]</a> An
attempt was made by Q. Servilius Caepio, consul in 106, to
restore the courts to the senate,<a id="FNanchor_2400" href="#Footnote_2400" class="fnanchor">[2400]</a> or possibly to compromise by
providing for an album composed of both senators and equites.<a id="FNanchor_2401" href="#Footnote_2401" class="fnanchor">[2401]</a>
The sources imply that the measure was accepted by the comitia;
but if so, it must have been immediately annulled, as it was not
carried into effect.<a id="FNanchor_2402" href="#Footnote_2402" class="fnanchor">[2402]</a> Within this period of reaction, and perhaps
as a part of it, falls the lex de libertinorum suffragiis of the
consul M. Aemilius Scaurus, 115. Although nothing certain
is known of it, we may suppose that it attempted again<a id="FNanchor_2403" href="#Footnote_2403" class="fnanchor">[2403]</a> to restrict
the libertini to the four city tribes.<a id="FNanchor_2404" href="#Footnote_2404" class="fnanchor">[2404]</a> About this time, too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
several acts seem to have been passed for diminishing the
pay of soldiers, probably undoing the Sempronian law on the
subject.<a id="FNanchor_2405" href="#Footnote_2405" class="fnanchor">[2405]</a></p>

<p>A glance at these reactionary measures alone would leave the
impression that the senate was recovering its entire supremacy.
This result might have been reached had it not been on the one
hand for the lasting inspiration of the Gracchan spirit in the
plebs and their leaders, and on the other the new position of
the equites. In 119 C. Marius, at once a representative of
the knights<a id="FNanchor_2406" href="#Footnote_2406" class="fnanchor">[2406]</a> and of the peasants, opposed as tribune of the
plebs the senatorial aristocracy, which now had to depend for
immediate support upon the populace.<a id="FNanchor_2407" href="#Footnote_2407" class="fnanchor">[2407]</a> The optimates had
greatly impaired the value of the secret ballot through the
custodes tabellarum, who stood on the pontes as well as by
the boxes (cistae) to keep watch over the voting. They were
often influential men<a id="FNanchor_2408" href="#Footnote_2408" class="fnanchor">[2408]</a>—in elections selected by the candidates<a id="FNanchor_2409" href="#Footnote_2409" class="fnanchor">[2409]</a>—who
used their influence with the voters, especially
of the principium or of the prerogative century,<a id="FNanchor_2410" href="#Footnote_2410" class="fnanchor">[2410]</a> thereby maintaining
for the aristocrats a high degree of control over the
comitia in spite of the ballot laws.<a id="FNanchor_2411" href="#Footnote_2411" class="fnanchor">[2411]</a> For this reason C. Marius
when tribune of the plebs carried an act for making the pontes
narrower that there might be room on them for the voters only.<a id="FNanchor_2412" href="#Footnote_2412" class="fnanchor">[2412]</a>
The politicians, however, soon found means of circumventing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
this law as well as the use of the ballot.<a id="FNanchor_2413" href="#Footnote_2413" class="fnanchor">[2413]</a> The populares could
expect little therefore from the plebiscite of C. Caelius, 107,
which by extending the ballot to trials of perduellio, completed
the abolition of oral voting in the comitia.<a id="FNanchor_2414" href="#Footnote_2414" class="fnanchor">[2414]</a></p>

<p>We find another sign of popular recovery in the assembly’s
resumption of the appointment of special judiciary commissions.<a id="FNanchor_2415" href="#Footnote_2415" class="fnanchor">[2415]</a>
One of the most remarkable courts of the kind was
that created in 113 for the trial of three Vestal virgins on a
charge of incest. The pontifex maximus, who possessed absolute
authority over the Vestals, had already pronounced judgment,
condemning one and acquitting the other two, when a
plebiscite of Sex. Peducaeus, taking the case out of his hands,
transferred it to a quaestio extraordinaria.<a id="FNanchor_2416" href="#Footnote_2416" class="fnanchor">[2416]</a> To such an extent
did the tribune apply the theory of popular sovereignty.<a id="FNanchor_2417" href="#Footnote_2417" class="fnanchor">[2417]</a> The
plebiscite of C. Mamilius, 109, ordered the appointment of a
court for the detection and punishment of those who had
accepted money from Jugurtha for aid rendered him against
the decrees of the senate and the interests of Rome. As it was
a blow aimed at the nobility, the people in the hatred they then
cherished against the governing class voted it with great spirit.<a id="FNanchor_2418" href="#Footnote_2418" class="fnanchor">[2418]</a>
In 105 the tribal comitia abrogated the proconsular imperium
of Q. Servilius Caepio,<a id="FNanchor_2419" href="#Footnote_2419" class="fnanchor">[2419]</a> and in the following year, they not only
appointed a special court to try him for embezzlement of the
gold found at Tolosa,<a id="FNanchor_2420" href="#Footnote_2420" class="fnanchor">[2420]</a> but through the plebiscite of L. Cassius
Longinus, they disqualified for membership of the senate any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
person whom the people had judicially condemned or whose
imperium they had abrogated.<a id="FNanchor_2421" href="#Footnote_2421" class="fnanchor">[2421]</a> These acts confirmed and
applied the principles underlying the deposition of Octavius
and the rogation of C. Gracchus concerning persons deposed
from office (abacti). In theory the people indirectly chose the
senators through their function of electing magistrates; and
they were only claiming this right when they insisted that he
should be prohibited from membership whom they had condemned
in either of the two ways described by the statute. It
must have seemed to the people, on the other hand, that the
tribunes, who were once more their true representatives, had as
good a right as any other magistrates to seats in the senate.
This feeling found expression in the Atinian plebiscite, enacted
between 122 and 102,<a id="FNanchor_2422" href="#Footnote_2422" class="fnanchor">[2422]</a> which gave the tribunes the ius sententiae
dicendae in the senate with the same right to censorial enrolment
as that enjoyed by the curule magistrates.<a id="FNanchor_2423" href="#Footnote_2423" class="fnanchor">[2423]</a></p>

<p>The growing strength of the people and at the same time the
increasing dependence of the optimates on religion for the control
of politics are indicated by a law of 103 concerning the
election of sacerdotes. More than a hundred years earlier<a id="FNanchor_2424" href="#Footnote_2424" class="fnanchor">[2424]</a> was
instituted the custom of electing the supreme pontiff and the
chief curio in comitia of seventeen tribes designated by lot.
Toward the end of the plutocratic régime C. Licinius Crassus
in the interest of the people attempted in vain to pass a law
for extending the principle to all the members of the more
important sacerdotal colleges.<a id="FNanchor_2425" href="#Footnote_2425" class="fnanchor">[2425]</a> The proposal was defeated by
the eloquence of C. Laelius,<a id="FNanchor_2426" href="#Footnote_2426" class="fnanchor">[2426]</a> but at length it was passed as the
lex de sacerdotiis of Cn. Domitius, tribune of the plebs in 103.
The statute affected the pontifical and augural colleges, the
decemviri sacris faciundis, and the epulones.<a id="FNanchor_2427" href="#Footnote_2427" class="fnanchor">[2427]</a> According to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
new arrangement when a place became vacant in any one of
these colleges, the members of the college drew up a list of
eligible candidates from whom the comitia sacerdotum, composed
as above described, made a choice.<a id="FNanchor_2428" href="#Footnote_2428" class="fnanchor">[2428]</a> In spite of this law
religion remained a political tool of the optimates.</p>

<p>Meantime the popular party succeeded in enacting economic
laws. A Porcian statute concerning interest, which may well
have aimed to benefit the poor, seems to be the work of
M. Porcius Cato, consul in 118. The author had to defend
the act against several attempts to repeal it.<a id="FNanchor_2429" href="#Footnote_2429" class="fnanchor">[2429]</a> In 109 under
the stress of the Cimbric war the consul M. Junius Silanus
passed an act for repealing several earlier laws which had
diminished the pay of soldiers. We may reasonably believe
that it restored the Sempronian law on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_2430" href="#Footnote_2430" class="fnanchor">[2430]</a> His
immediate object was to encourage enlistments.<a id="FNanchor_2431" href="#Footnote_2431" class="fnanchor">[2431]</a> An agrarian
rogation was offered by L. Marcius Philipus, tribune of the
plebs in 104. As the author was at heart a democrat, his
measure was doubtless inspired with the spirit of the Gracchi.
Perhaps it aimed to restore their law; but lacking determination,
the proposer readily allowed it to be voted down.<a id="FNanchor_2432" href="#Footnote_2432" class="fnanchor">[2432]</a> The
monetary lex Clodia, which probably belongs to the same
year, has no political significance.<a id="FNanchor_2433" href="#Footnote_2433" class="fnanchor">[2433]</a></p>

<h4>III. <i>The Appuleian Legislation and the Rule of the Moderate
Optimates</i><br />
103-88</h4>

<p>Through the legislative acts above described we can trace
the speedy restoration of the democracy and of comitial legislative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
power after the overthrow of C. Sempronius Gracchus.
We are now approaching a second crisis in which the aristocracy
had to struggle for existence. Against it was formed
a combination of three powerful men, C. Marius, supported
by the knights and the municipes,<a id="FNanchor_2434" href="#Footnote_2434" class="fnanchor">[2434]</a> C. Servilius Glaucia, and
L. Appuleius Saturninus. It is almost certain that this Servilius
is to be identified with the author of the lex repetundarum
of 111 or thereabout, probably a plebiscite, which repealed
the Acilian law on the same subject.<a id="FNanchor_2435" href="#Footnote_2435" class="fnanchor">[2435]</a> In important respects
his statute was an improvement on earlier regulations of the
crime. “Glaucia’s alteration in procedure was thorough and
permanent. He introduced the system of the ‘second hearing’—an
obligatory renewal of the trial, which rendered it
possible for counsel to discuss evidence which had already
been given, and for jurors to get a grasp of the mass of
scattered data which had been presented to their notice<a id="FNanchor_2436" href="#Footnote_2436" class="fnanchor">[2436]</a>—and
he also made it possible to recover damages, not only
from the chief malefactor, but from all who had dishonestly
shared his spoils.”<a id="FNanchor_2437" href="#Footnote_2437" class="fnanchor">[2437]</a> These principles were taken up into
the Cornelian law which superseded it in 81.<a id="FNanchor_2438" href="#Footnote_2438" class="fnanchor">[2438]</a> The circumstance
that the man whom the optimates regarded as merely a vulgar
demagogue was the author of so statesmanlike a measure
ought to militate against their opinion, not only of him, but also
of his associates. He, too, represented the knights,<a id="FNanchor_2439" href="#Footnote_2439" class="fnanchor">[2439]</a> whereas
Appuleius was a champion of the rural plebs against the
senate and the populace. As tribune of the plebs in 103
the latter proposed a law for the assignment of lands in the
province of Africa to the retiring veterans of Marius in lots
of a hundred iugera each. When Baebius, a colleague, interceded,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
the people pelted him with stones and drove him from
the assembly. Thus the law was violently carried, but we
hear nothing more of it. Probably it was not enforced.<a id="FNanchor_2440" href="#Footnote_2440" class="fnanchor">[2440]</a> This
act marks an epoch in the history of Roman colonization;
through it the government first expressed its intention to
provide discharged soldiers with farms, a departure made
necessary by the Marian policy of filling the army with capite
censi.<a id="FNanchor_2441" href="#Footnote_2441" class="fnanchor">[2441]</a> Either to this tribunate or more probably to his second
belongs the lex de maiestate (minuta),<a id="FNanchor_2442" href="#Footnote_2442" class="fnanchor">[2442]</a> the first of the kind
in Roman history. It defined the crime and made general
provisions for the prosecution of those who were accused of
it.<a id="FNanchor_2443" href="#Footnote_2443" class="fnanchor">[2443]</a> The same statute provided for the establishment of a
court which seems to have been standing rather than special.<a id="FNanchor_2444" href="#Footnote_2444" class="fnanchor">[2444]</a></p>

<p>In his second tribunate, 100, supported by Marius, consul
a sixth time, and by Servilius, Appuleius proposed and carried
a law for the founding of settlements of the Marian veterans
in Sicily, Corsica, Achaia, and Macedonia.<a id="FNanchor_2445" href="#Footnote_2445" class="fnanchor">[2445]</a> Marius was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
be a commissioner for conducting these colonies, and was
to have the right to enroll as citizens in each settlement a
specified number of aliens.<a id="FNanchor_2446" href="#Footnote_2446" class="fnanchor">[2446]</a> The object of the latter clause
was doubtless to provide for the Italian veterans in his
army. He proposed further that certain Transpadane lands
which the Cimbri had taken from the Gauls and which Marius
had recovered should be distributed among the citizens and
the Italians.<a id="FNanchor_2447" href="#Footnote_2447" class="fnanchor">[2447]</a> Another proposal was for the monthly sale
of a specified number of modii of grain to every citizen resident
of Rome who desired it at five-sixths of an as to the modius—a
merely nominal price.<a id="FNanchor_2448" href="#Footnote_2448" class="fnanchor">[2448]</a> It is not known whether the colonial,
agrarian, and frumentarian measures were separate enactments
or articles of one statute; or the colonial and agrarian
provisions may alone have been combined. However that
may be, we are informed by Appian<a id="FNanchor_2449" href="#Footnote_2449" class="fnanchor">[2449]</a> that attached to the
agrarian measure—whether to the others also is nowhere
stated—was an article which provided that if the bill should
become a law, the senators within five days should swear to
uphold it, or if any senator refused to take the oath, he
should be expelled from the senate and should be liable to
a fine of twenty talents, the Greek equivalent of about five
hundred thousand sesterces.<a id="FNanchor_2450" href="#Footnote_2450" class="fnanchor">[2450]</a> The rural plebs, including many
discharged soldiers of Marius, swarmed into the comitia at
the call of the tribune and violently passed the law. Marius,
who as a consul and a knight disapproved of such illegality,
set for the senators the example of swearing to the law,
“in so far as it was a law,” which left them a loophole of
escape from its provisions should they afterward so determine.
Metellus, who alone of the senators refused the oath, was
forced into exile and an interdict from fire and water was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
passed against him by the tribes on the motion of Saturninus.<a id="FNanchor_2451" href="#Footnote_2451" class="fnanchor">[2451]</a>
Soon afterward an election riot gave the senate a pretext
for martial law. Placed under custody, Saturninus and some
fellow officials were stoned to death by a mob. His measures
were then annulled by the senate on the ground that they had
been violently passed;<a id="FNanchor_2452" href="#Footnote_2452" class="fnanchor">[2452]</a> nevertheless Mariana was founded by
Marius in Corsica, apparently under the colonial provision.<a id="FNanchor_2453" href="#Footnote_2453" class="fnanchor">[2453]</a>
The import of the agrarian law of Sex. Titius, tribune of the
plebs in 99, is unknown.<a id="FNanchor_2454" href="#Footnote_2454" class="fnanchor">[2454]</a> It may have been merely a reënactment
of the Appuleian measure. At all events before it could
be put into force it was annulled by the senate on the ground
that it had been passed by violence and against the intercession
of colleagues.<a id="FNanchor_2455" href="#Footnote_2455" class="fnanchor">[2455]</a></p>

<p>The optimates, having again triumphed over the democracy,
adopted a policy of moderation. Their consuls of 98, Q. Caecilius
Metellus and T. Didius, attempted by a mild statute to
check the most flagrant abuses of tribunician legislation, (1) the
combination of various dissimilar provisions in one bill (lex
satura) for the purpose of drawing the votes of all parties,
(2) the passing of bills through the assembly by surprise. Their
law accordingly, reviving usages once in force but recently
neglected, forbade such combinations<a id="FNanchor_2456" href="#Footnote_2456" class="fnanchor">[2456]</a> and ordered that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
promulgation should precede the voting by at least a trinum
nundinum—an interval which included three market days.<a id="FNanchor_2457" href="#Footnote_2457" class="fnanchor">[2457]</a>
Similarly in 95 their consuls, L. Licinius Crassus and Q. Mucius
Scaevola, aimed by an equally moderate law to check the usurpation
of the citizenship on the part of aliens. It forbade peregrini
to perform the functions of citizens, though it did not order
the innocent among them to leave Rome.<a id="FNanchor_2458" href="#Footnote_2458" class="fnanchor">[2458]</a> It provided for the
appointment of a special commission to discover and punish
usurpers of the citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_2459" href="#Footnote_2459" class="fnanchor">[2459]</a> Those found guilty were sent
back to their communities.<a id="FNanchor_2460" href="#Footnote_2460" class="fnanchor">[2460]</a> Though the authors were eminent
in justice and cherished the best intentions, their law proved to
be not merely useless but most pernicious to the state,<a id="FNanchor_2461" href="#Footnote_2461" class="fnanchor">[2461]</a> as it
helped drive the Italians to revolt.<a id="FNanchor_2462" href="#Footnote_2462" class="fnanchor">[2462]</a></p>

<p>The next attempt at reform proceeded from the inmost circle
of the aristocracy.<a id="FNanchor_2463" href="#Footnote_2463" class="fnanchor">[2463]</a> M. Livius Drusus, tribune of the plebs in
91, was a man of the highest nobility, wealthy, eloquent, and
upright at heart, the son of that Livius who had opposed C.
Gracchus.<a id="FNanchor_2464" href="#Footnote_2464" class="fnanchor">[2464]</a> Regarding his aims and the quality of his statesmanship
conflicting opinions have been expressed by modern
scholars. The sources intimate that he wished primarily to
strengthen the senate by breaking away from its hide-bound
conservatism and undertaking various pressing reforms. His
agrarian measure was conceived in the Gracchan spirit but was
more radical.<a id="FNanchor_2465" href="#Footnote_2465" class="fnanchor">[2465]</a> Appian<a id="FNanchor_2466" href="#Footnote_2466" class="fnanchor">[2466]</a> states that it proposed the founding
of colonies voted long ago but not yet established. Reference
must be to the twelve colonies planned by his father.<a id="FNanchor_2467" href="#Footnote_2467" class="fnanchor">[2467]</a> It probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
abolished the statute of 111 and ordered the division not
only of the Campanian lands,<a id="FNanchor_2468" href="#Footnote_2468" class="fnanchor">[2468]</a> but also of those public domains
which were held by the allied communities—in brief, of all the
public land remaining in Italy and Sicily;<a id="FNanchor_2469" href="#Footnote_2469" class="fnanchor">[2469]</a> and it established a
board of ten for making the assignments.<a id="FNanchor_2470" href="#Footnote_2470" class="fnanchor">[2470]</a> Livy<a id="FNanchor_2471" href="#Footnote_2471" class="fnanchor">[2471]</a> attributes to
the author a frumentarian proposal, though we are not informed
of its character. The aim must have been to win the support of
the populace for his other measures.<a id="FNanchor_2472" href="#Footnote_2472" class="fnanchor">[2472]</a></p>

<p>He further proposed to mix with the silver coinage an eighth
part of copper,<a id="FNanchor_2473" href="#Footnote_2473" class="fnanchor">[2473]</a> the proceeds of this gain to be applied perhaps
to the execution of his frumentarian project.<a id="FNanchor_2474" href="#Footnote_2474" class="fnanchor">[2474]</a> There is much
controversy as to the intent of his judiciary reform. Appian<a id="FNanchor_2475" href="#Footnote_2475" class="fnanchor">[2475]</a>
supposes that he wished to add three hundred knights to the
senate and to draw the jurors from that body thus enlarged.
Velleius<a id="FNanchor_2476" href="#Footnote_2476" class="fnanchor">[2476]</a> is of the opinion that his aim was to transfer the
iudicia to the senate; whereas the epitomator of Livy<a id="FNanchor_2477" href="#Footnote_2477" class="fnanchor">[2477]</a> directly
states that he provided for making up the iudicia of senators and
knights in equal numbers. We may partially reconcile these
conflicting statements by supposing that he planned to compose
the jurors’ album of six hundred senators and knights in
equal numbers, by which expedient he hoped to bring these two
hostile orders back to their former harmony,<a id="FNanchor_2478" href="#Footnote_2478" class="fnanchor">[2478]</a> while serving the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
interests of the senate and ridding the state of the corrupt and
tyrannical rule of the knights.<a id="FNanchor_2479" href="#Footnote_2479" class="fnanchor">[2479]</a> By a special article of the rogation
a quaestio, probably perpetua, was to be appointed to inquire
into the cases of bribery of jurors and to punish the guilty.<a id="FNanchor_2480" href="#Footnote_2480" class="fnanchor">[2480]</a>
His most radical measure, introduced after opposition to his
other reforms began to develop,<a id="FNanchor_2481" href="#Footnote_2481" class="fnanchor">[2481]</a> was for extending the citizenship
to the Latins<a id="FNanchor_2482" href="#Footnote_2482" class="fnanchor">[2482]</a> and to all the Italians.<a id="FNanchor_2483" href="#Footnote_2483" class="fnanchor">[2483]</a> This group of proposals,
designed for the benefit of all parties, proved distasteful
to all. The senators found a ground for complaint in the circumstance
that the knights would have equal power with them
in the courts; the knights were unwilling to surrender their
judicial control or to grant the franchise to the Italians; the
wealthy Italians feared they might lose the public lands which
they still held. Only the poor among the Romans and allies
supported the proposal in the hope of profiting by the distribution
of lands.<a id="FNanchor_2484" href="#Footnote_2484" class="fnanchor">[2484]</a> The agrarian, frumentarian, monetary, and judiciary
measures were combined in one statute, and passed with
violence<a id="FNanchor_2485" href="#Footnote_2485" class="fnanchor">[2485]</a> and contrary to the omens.<a id="FNanchor_2486" href="#Footnote_2486" class="fnanchor">[2486]</a> On these grounds and
furthermore because they violated the article of the Caecilian-Didian
statute forbidding the passing of a lex satura, they were
annulled by the senate.<a id="FNanchor_2487" href="#Footnote_2487" class="fnanchor">[2487]</a> Although Drusus might have interposed
his veto against this decree, he preferred rather to disregard
it, most probably on the theory that the senatorial authority
did not avail against the sovereign will of the people.<a id="FNanchor_2488" href="#Footnote_2488" class="fnanchor">[2488]</a> Aware
that his intercession would but postpone the annulment to another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
year, he contented himself with informing his opponents that
his measures were absolutely necessary for the security of the
state, and that those who offended against them did it at their
peril. He proceeded to carry his statute into immediate effect.<a id="FNanchor_2489" href="#Footnote_2489" class="fnanchor">[2489]</a>
A plebiscite of Saufeius, a colleague, established a commission
of five in addition to the ten provided for by the Livian statute;
and Livius was elected a member of both commissions.<a id="FNanchor_2490" href="#Footnote_2490" class="fnanchor">[2490]</a>
After his murder the Livian and Saufeian statutes were both
considered null and void.<a id="FNanchor_2491" href="#Footnote_2491" class="fnanchor">[2491]</a></p>

<p>The lex Remmia de calumniatoribus, which was enacted
before 80, may belong to the year of the Livian attempt at
reform, 91;<a id="FNanchor_2492" href="#Footnote_2492" class="fnanchor">[2492]</a> and in that case it would be most natural to
regard it as a piece of counter legislation to offset the proposal
for establishing a court for the trial of jurors accused of bribery.
The complainant who was proved malicious it rendered liable to
trial and punishment with the loss of citizenship and the branding
of his forehead with the letter K (for Kalumniator).<a id="FNanchor_2493" href="#Footnote_2493" class="fnanchor">[2493]</a> This
we may believe was the defiance offered by the knights to those
who were attempting to bring them to account for their conduct
as judges. Exulting in their victory over Drusus, they expressed
their antipathy to the Italian movement in a lex de maiestate of
Q. Varius, tribune of the plebs in 90. They stood round the
Rostra with drawn daggers and forced it through the comitia
in spite of tribunician intercession. It supplanted the Appuleian
law on the subject by a severe provision against those
who encouraged the Italians to demand the citizenship or in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
any way to conspire or to revolt against the Roman people.
It must have contained an article, too, concerning seditions.<a id="FNanchor_2494" href="#Footnote_2494" class="fnanchor">[2494]</a>
The court which it established was to sit on all ordinary dies
fasti, undisturbed by iustitia,<a id="FNanchor_2495" href="#Footnote_2495" class="fnanchor">[2495]</a> and was to be a quaestio perpetua.<a id="FNanchor_2496" href="#Footnote_2496" class="fnanchor">[2496]</a>
Now that two attempts, the Appuleian and the Livian,
to substitute more popular measures for the Sempronian frumentarian
law had failed, the optimates found themselves strong
enough to supersede the Sempronian act by one less popular.
This was the Octavian law,<a id="FNanchor_2497" href="#Footnote_2497" class="fnanchor">[2497]</a> the contents of which are unknown,
but which received the praise of Cicero for its moderation.<a id="FNanchor_2498" href="#Footnote_2498" class="fnanchor">[2498]</a></p>

<p>The Social War, following close upon the murder of Livius
Drusus, compelled the Romans to grant the citizenship to the
Italians. This result was brought about by a succession of
statutes. A law of the consul L. Julius Caesar, 90, bestowed
the citizenship upon the Latins<a id="FNanchor_2499" href="#Footnote_2499" class="fnanchor">[2499]</a> and on all the Italians who had
not taken arms against Rome<a id="FNanchor_2500" href="#Footnote_2500" class="fnanchor">[2500]</a> and who were willing to accept
the gift.<a id="FNanchor_2501" href="#Footnote_2501" class="fnanchor">[2501]</a> The same statute probably regulated the assignment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
of these new citizens to the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_2502" href="#Footnote_2502" class="fnanchor">[2502]</a> In the following year a law
of L. Calpurnius Piso, probably a tribune, granted the commanding
general power, apparently absolute, to bestow the right of
the city upon the soldiers under his orders.<a id="FNanchor_2503" href="#Footnote_2503" class="fnanchor">[2503]</a> Another statute of
89, carried by M. Plautius Silvanus and C. Papirius Carbo, tribunes
of the plebs, granted the citizenship to all members of allied
communities who were domiciled in Italy at the time the statute
was passed and who within sixty days should signify to the
praetor at Rome their willingness to accept the offer.<a id="FNanchor_2504" href="#Footnote_2504" class="fnanchor">[2504]</a> The
object of this measure was not only to expedite the reconciliation,
but also to make the work of the next censors practicable.
The citizenship thus granted involved the right of suffrage,
though in new tribes which voted after the others. Many
Italians, especially the Lucanians and the Samnites, took no
notice of the offer.<a id="FNanchor_2505" href="#Footnote_2505" class="fnanchor">[2505]</a> In the same year Cn. Pompeius Strabo, a
consul, proposed and carried a law which seems to have empowered
himself at his discretion to invest with full citizenship
those Transpadani who already enjoyed the Latin rights, and
to confer upon the rest the ius Latii.<a id="FNanchor_2506" href="#Footnote_2506" class="fnanchor">[2506]</a></p>

<p>The question as to the composition of the courts, still left
unsettled, was taken up by M. Plautius Silvanus, the tribune
referred to above. His statute transferred the filling of the
album from the urban praetor to the tribes, which were to
elect each fifteen members. The law made the qualifications
of the iudices independent of the social classes. Under it
accordingly senators and a few common plebeians in addition to
equites served as jurors, so that the equestrian control of the
courts was partially checked.<a id="FNanchor_2507" href="#Footnote_2507" class="fnanchor">[2507]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span></p>

<p>Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_2508" href="#Footnote_2508" class="fnanchor">[2508]</a> supposes that these jurors were for the quaestio
de maiestate only. For this opinion he depends upon the assertion
of Cicero<a id="FNanchor_2509" href="#Footnote_2509" class="fnanchor">[2509]</a> that the equites remained till Sulla’s legislation
in uninterrupted possession of the courts. The authority of
Cicero, however, would allow us to assume that while the equites
lost the legal monopoly they retained practical control. However
that may be, it is hardly possible that this reactionary
measure survived the proletarian uprising under Marius and
Cinna. The lex agraria of the same Plautius seems to have
been intended for supplying the veterans of the Social War
with farms.<a id="FNanchor_2510" href="#Footnote_2510" class="fnanchor">[2510]</a> The lex Papiria, which introduced the semiuncial
<i>as</i>, is doubtless to be assigned to C. Papirius Carbo, the colleague
of Plautius above mentioned. If so, the object was to
relieve slightly the financial embarrassment caused by the war,
and more particularly to bring the small coins of Rome into
correspondence with those of Italy.<a id="FNanchor_2511" href="#Footnote_2511" class="fnanchor">[2511]</a></p>

<h4>IV. <i>The Political Equalization of Italy</i><br />
88-83</h4>

<p>With many Italians still in revolt and the others smarting
under the inferior citizenship eked out to them, and with Mithridates
threatening the existence of the empire, Rome should
have adopted a policy of domestic conciliation. Under these
circumstances Sulla, consul in 88, showed a lamentable want of
tact in expressing the sentiment that there could be no peace in
Italy as long as a single Samnite lived<a id="FNanchor_2512" href="#Footnote_2512" class="fnanchor">[2512]</a>—a curiously antiquated
frame of mind for a statesman of his shrewdness. The cause
of the new citizens was taken up by P. Sulpicius Rufus, a patrician
who had forsaken his rank to qualify himself for the
plebeian tribunate.<a id="FNanchor_2513" href="#Footnote_2513" class="fnanchor">[2513]</a> A man of marvellous eloquence, he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
been an adherent of Drusus, though more inclined to the equestrian
interests. As tribune of the plebs, 88, he seems to have
tried to win the support of the senate and of the equestrian order
to his policy; but failing in the attempt, he looked for aid to the
commons and to a small band of knights who were faithful to
him. His rogation contained the following articles: (1) that
the new citizens and the libertini should be distributed among all
the tribes,<a id="FNanchor_2514" href="#Footnote_2514" class="fnanchor">[2514]</a> with a view to completing the plan of Livius Drusus
for the political equalization of Italy; (2) that those who
had been driven from the state by violence should be recalled.<a id="FNanchor_2515" href="#Footnote_2515" class="fnanchor">[2515]</a>
This article was probably for the benefit of those knights against
whom the Varian law had been turned.<a id="FNanchor_2516" href="#Footnote_2516" class="fnanchor">[2516]</a> His rogation provided
further, (3) that no one who owed more than two thousand denarii
should be a senator.<a id="FNanchor_2517" href="#Footnote_2517" class="fnanchor">[2517]</a> Money was scarce because of the war;<a id="FNanchor_2518" href="#Footnote_2518" class="fnanchor">[2518]</a> and
Sulpicius must have felt that if the senators, most of whom were
abundantly able, should pay their debts, it would go far toward
relieving the stringency, and that if any were ejected because
of failure to pay, an opportunity would be afforded of promoting
equites to the vacant places. The consuls of the year, L.
Cornelius Sulla and Q. Pompeius Rufus, attempted to prevent a
vote on these radical measures by interposing a cessation of
business for many days through the proclamation of a festival.<a id="FNanchor_2519" href="#Footnote_2519" class="fnanchor">[2519]</a>
With his armed followers Sulpicius forced the consuls to recall
the proclamation, whereupon Sulla fled for safety to his army
at Nola. Sulpicius then added to his statute a fourth article to
the effect that the imperium of Sulla should be abrogated and
that the province of Asia, involving the conduct of the war
against Mithridates, should be given to Marius as proconsul,<a id="FNanchor_2520" href="#Footnote_2520" class="fnanchor">[2520]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
although the latter was now but a private citizen. Doubtless
Sulpicius understood that there could be no guarantee for the
execution of his statute as long as Sulla remained in power, and
furthermore that the advancement of Marius would be a great
gain for the knights. The bill was passed by the comitia of
tribes; but Sulla, far from delivering up his command, marched
his army into Rome to settle the question in his own interest by
the sword. On his initiative Sulpicius, Marius, and ten of their
associates were declared public enemies by a decree of the senate
ratified by a popular vote.<a id="FNanchor_2521" href="#Footnote_2521" class="fnanchor">[2521]</a> There is no need of assuming
that the supporters of the tribune turned against him; the optimates
were as clever as their opponents at packing assemblies.
The absurdity of continuing the worn-out comitial machinery as
a factor of government is nowhere more apparent than on this
page of history, which records that the comitia a few days after
adopting the measures of Sulpicius, voted to outlaw him and his
friends. Marius fled; Sulpicius and several adherents were
killed. Thereupon the senate annulled the entire Sulpician
statute on the ground that it had been violently passed.<a id="FNanchor_2522" href="#Footnote_2522" class="fnanchor">[2522]</a></p>

<p>No statesman, however opposed to popular government, could
think of abolishing the comitia or even of putting an end to
their legislative function. But the democracy could be effectually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
checked by reducing the legislative power of the assemblies
to the harmless function of ratifying decrees of the senate.
This result Sulla and Pompeius aimed to reach by renewing an
ancient law<a id="FNanchor_2523" href="#Footnote_2523" class="fnanchor">[2523]</a> that no measure should ever again be brought
before the people which had not been previously considered
and agreed to by the senate.<a id="FNanchor_2524" href="#Footnote_2524" class="fnanchor">[2524]</a> A closely related law of the same
consuls ordered that “the voting should not be by tribes but by
centuries, as King Tullius had ordained.”<a id="FNanchor_2525" href="#Footnote_2525" class="fnanchor">[2525]</a> This statement has
often been interpreted to signify the restoration of the earlier
form of comitia centuriata. But it seems most improbable that,
on the point of setting out for a long, distant war, Sulla should
think of restoring an organization which had been obsolete for
more than a century and a half, and which could have been
known to none but antiquarians. With his clear, practical intelligence
he could not have failed to see the insuperable difficulty
of restoring the ancient definitions of the classes in terms
of iugera or even on the later basis of the libral <i>as</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2526" href="#Footnote_2526" class="fnanchor">[2526]</a> Furthermore
no censors were then at hand to undertake the work, and
it was altogether unlikely that during his absence any could be
elected who would be willing to apply themselves to the revitalization
of the antique mummy. Such a measure, too, as
Meyer<a id="FNanchor_2527" href="#Footnote_2527" class="fnanchor">[2527]</a> has pointed out, would place the control of the assembly
in the hands, not of the senate, but of the knights, his
mortal enemies. It is far more reasonable to suppose that this
act transferred the function of ratifying laws from the tribal to
the centuriate comitia, to restore the arrangement supposed to
have been introduced by Servius Tullius.<a id="FNanchor_2528" href="#Footnote_2528" class="fnanchor">[2528]</a> If this reasoning is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
correct, the act under consideration totally abolished the legislative
initiative of the tribunes.<a id="FNanchor_2529" href="#Footnote_2529" class="fnanchor">[2529]</a> The other Cornelian-Pompeian
law mentioned by Appian must have applied, accordingly, not
to the tribunate but to the other magistracies.<a id="FNanchor_2530" href="#Footnote_2530" class="fnanchor">[2530]</a> The current
interpretation, which involves the theory of a return to the original
centuriate system, requires further examination. Its chief
basis is the statement of Appian that no law should be brought
before the πλῆθος which had not been previously considered in
the senate. It is commonly assumed that he uses δῆμος to designate
the whole citizen body, and πλῆθος the exclusively plebeian
assembly under tribunician presidency. A study of his
usage, however, proves that he makes no such discrimination.
Δῆμος is ordinarily the people in general, especially as distinguished
from the βουλή,<a id="FNanchor_2531" href="#Footnote_2531" class="fnanchor">[2531]</a> parallel to Livy’s common distinction
between plebs and senatus. It is the technical term for
the plebs in their tribal comitia under tribunician presidency.<a id="FNanchor_2532" href="#Footnote_2532" class="fnanchor">[2532]</a>
Rarely it signifies the state<a id="FNanchor_2533" href="#Footnote_2533" class="fnanchor">[2533]</a> with reference to the interest of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
people. Πλῆθος, on the other hand, ordinarily denotes the
masses, multitude, rabble,<a id="FNanchor_2534" href="#Footnote_2534" class="fnanchor">[2534]</a> including the crowd gathered not
only in a tribunician assembly<a id="FNanchor_2535" href="#Footnote_2535" class="fnanchor">[2535]</a> but also in the ἐκκλησία (here
meaning contio) under the presidency of a patrician magistrate.<a id="FNanchor_2536" href="#Footnote_2536" class="fnanchor">[2536]</a>
But πλῆθος is never technically or officially used to
denote any assembly either of the populus or of the plebs. In
the passage under discussion Appian’s statement of the Cornelian-Pompeian
law is εἰσηγοῦντό τε μηδὲν ἔτι ἀπροβούλευτον ἐς
τὸν δῆμον ἐσφέρεσθαι, in which he uses δῆμος according to his
custom to designate the popular assembly without specifying
whether it is of the populus or of the plebs. In commenting
on it he substitutes πλῆθος for δῆμος for the purpose, not of
defining the assembly as tribunician, but of contrasting the
masses in the assembly with the nobles in the senate: ἐσ τὸ
πλῆθος is substantially equivalent to ἐν τοῖς πένησι καὶ θρασυτάτοις
used just below; Sulla wished nothing to be submitted to
the masses in the comitia centuriata before it had been considered
by the senate.</p>

<p>Appian<a id="FNanchor_2537" href="#Footnote_2537" class="fnanchor">[2537]</a> attributes to Sulla for this early date an attempt to
increase the number of senators. “They (the consuls) enrolled
three hundred nobles in the senate, which had been
reduced in numbers and for that reason had come to be despised.”
He does not state, however, by what authority the
consuls made this extraordinary adlectio; and it is in fact improbable
that the senate had so dwindled. However that may
be, the increase did not take permanent effect at this time.<a id="FNanchor_2538" href="#Footnote_2538" class="fnanchor">[2538]</a>
Two other laws of these consuls are briefly mentioned: (1) for
planting colonies,<a id="FNanchor_2539" href="#Footnote_2539" class="fnanchor">[2539]</a> of which nothing is known; (2) a lex
unciaria.<a id="FNanchor_2540" href="#Footnote_2540" class="fnanchor">[2540]</a> The latter may have been a reduction of existing
debts by one-twelfth of the principle, or a lowering of the maximal
rate of interest to 8⅓ per cent;<a id="FNanchor_2541" href="#Footnote_2541" class="fnanchor">[2541]</a> or it may have been a general
insolvency law, providing for the payment of debts in instalments.<a id="FNanchor_2542" href="#Footnote_2542" class="fnanchor">[2542]</a>
The chief value of these measures, even if we knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
them in detail, would be to reveal the idea of their authors; for
they were all repealed in the following year on the initiative
of the consul L. Cornelius Cinna, probably by a comitial
vote.<a id="FNanchor_2543" href="#Footnote_2543" class="fnanchor">[2543]</a></p>

<p>Cinna then proposed (1) a renewal of the Sulpician plebiscite
for the enrolment of the new citizens and the libertini among all
the tribes,<a id="FNanchor_2544" href="#Footnote_2544" class="fnanchor">[2544]</a> (2) a recall of Marius and the other exiles.<a id="FNanchor_2545" href="#Footnote_2545" class="fnanchor">[2545]</a> Before
these measures could be carried, the consul was driven from
Rome and deposed from office by an act of the senate on the
motion of Cn. Octavius, the other consul.<a id="FNanchor_2546" href="#Footnote_2546" class="fnanchor">[2546]</a> This is the only
certain instance of the abrogation of the civil imperium known
to the history of the republic. Cinna returned at the head of
an army; and after taking forcible possession of the city, he
carried his law concerning the exiles through the assembly either
on his own motion or that of a tribune.<a id="FNanchor_2547" href="#Footnote_2547" class="fnanchor">[2547]</a> As the senate, reversing
its earlier action,<a id="FNanchor_2548" href="#Footnote_2548" class="fnanchor">[2548]</a> had already legalized the Sulpician provision
concerning the distribution of the libertini and the new citizens
among the thirty-five tribes,<a id="FNanchor_2549" href="#Footnote_2549" class="fnanchor">[2549]</a> it was without reënactment
carried into effect in 84.<a id="FNanchor_2550" href="#Footnote_2550" class="fnanchor">[2550]</a> The execution of this measure completed
the political unification of Italy. Meantime L. Valerius
Flaccus, consul suffectus in 86, to relieve the financial distress,
passed a law which compelled creditors to satisfy themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
with one-fourth of the amount due.<a id="FNanchor_2551" href="#Footnote_2551" class="fnanchor">[2551]</a> In 83 M. Junius Brutus,
tribune of the plebs, proposed and carried, as a milder measure
of relief, a law for the colonization of Capua.<a id="FNanchor_2552" href="#Footnote_2552" class="fnanchor">[2552]</a></p>

<h4>I. <i>The Cornelian Reaction</i><br />
82-70</h4>

<p>In November, 82, after destroying his political enemies by
war and proscription, Sulla was ready to begin the work of
restoring the aristocratic constitution. As both consuls, Cn.
Papirius Carbo and C. Marius the younger,<a id="FNanchor_2553" href="#Footnote_2553" class="fnanchor">[2553]</a> were dead, and as
Sulla desired above all things to give his legislation a constitutional
basis, he advised the senate to appoint an interrex. The
choice fell on L. Valerius Flaccus, princeps senatus, a moderate
in politics. Thereupon Sulla withdrew from Rome, leaving the
civil authorities free in appearance to act at their discretion. In
reality he had determined to retain control of affairs; and accordingly
he wrote to Valerius advising the appointment of a
dictator, not for a fixed time but till the general unrest should
be quieted. He suggested himself as a suitable person for the
place. Valerius obediently proposed and carried a law through
the comitia centuriata, (1) which made Sulla dictator rei publicae
constituendae for an indefinite time with absolute power
over the lives and property of the citizens,<a id="FNanchor_2554" href="#Footnote_2554" class="fnanchor">[2554]</a> (2) which legalized
all his past acts, both as consul and as proconsul,<a id="FNanchor_2555" href="#Footnote_2555" class="fnanchor">[2555]</a> including his
arrangements in Asia as well as his proscriptions and confiscations.<a id="FNanchor_2556" href="#Footnote_2556" class="fnanchor">[2556]</a>
He returned to the city, appointed Valerius his magister<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
equitum,<a id="FNanchor_2557" href="#Footnote_2557" class="fnanchor">[2557]</a> and took to himself twenty-four lictors in addition to
a less formal guard of servants and friends.<a id="FNanchor_2558" href="#Footnote_2558" class="fnanchor">[2558]</a> Without delay he
began the promulgation of laws, which undoubtedly he had long
been planning. They are here grouped according to subject,
with an occasional reference to their chronological relation.</p>

<p>First he applied himself to curbing the power of the tribunate,
an institution in which centred the strength of the democracy.
A statute for that purpose he must have felt compelled
to draw up and pass before the next tribunician election. Instead
of renewing his earlier law, however, for absolutely
depriving the tribunes of initiative in legislation,<a id="FNanchor_2559" href="#Footnote_2559" class="fnanchor">[2559]</a> he enacted
simply that the previous consent of the senate should be
necessary to bills brought by them before the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_2560" href="#Footnote_2560" class="fnanchor">[2560]</a> By
another article of this law he limited the right of tribunes to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
address the people in contiones.<a id="FNanchor_2561" href="#Footnote_2561" class="fnanchor">[2561]</a> The range of their intercession
was also greatly limited.<a id="FNanchor_2562" href="#Footnote_2562" class="fnanchor">[2562]</a> Their function of bringing prosecutions
before the people underwent restriction not only through
the laws affecting the quaestiones but also by special enactment;<a id="FNanchor_2563" href="#Footnote_2563" class="fnanchor">[2563]</a>
for had they retained their unlimited right to prosecute,
they could at once have regained all their other power.<a id="FNanchor_2564" href="#Footnote_2564" class="fnanchor">[2564]</a>
Little was left them but their original auxilii latio adversus
imperium.<a id="FNanchor_2565" href="#Footnote_2565" class="fnanchor">[2565]</a> Finally the office was made unattractive to the
ambitious by the provision that those who held it were thereby
disqualified for other magistracies.<a id="FNanchor_2566" href="#Footnote_2566" class="fnanchor">[2566]</a> By these measures the
most vital and powerful institution in the state was reduced to a
shadow without substance.<a id="FNanchor_2567" href="#Footnote_2567" class="fnanchor">[2567]</a> The return to conditions preceding
the Hortensian legislation, in some respects even the Decemviral
legislation, was, as Fröhlich<a id="FNanchor_2568" href="#Footnote_2568" class="fnanchor">[2568]</a> remarks, a backward step
such as finds few parallels in history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span></p>

<p>About a year<a id="FNanchor_2569" href="#Footnote_2569" class="fnanchor">[2569]</a> after limiting the power of the tribunes Sulla
proceeded to regulate the other offices through his lex de magistratibus,
81. This statute, making use of the principle contained
in the lex Villia annalis,<a id="FNanchor_2570" href="#Footnote_2570" class="fnanchor">[2570]</a> prescribed (1) that no one could
be consul before he had been praetor or praetor before he had
been quaestor,<a id="FNanchor_2571" href="#Footnote_2571" class="fnanchor">[2571]</a> (2) that a space of two years should intervene
between the holding of consecutive offices.<a id="FNanchor_2572" href="#Footnote_2572" class="fnanchor">[2572]</a> (3) The minimal
age of the quaestor it fixed at thirty-seven.<a id="FNanchor_2573" href="#Footnote_2573" class="fnanchor">[2573]</a> The fortieth year
was therefore the age for the praetorship and the forty-third for
the office of consul. The aedileship, while bringing the holder
a positive advantage for his future career, was never an essential
step to a higher place. But in case this office was taken, the
biennial interval had to be observed.<a id="FNanchor_2574" href="#Footnote_2574" class="fnanchor">[2574]</a> The quaestorship Sulla
made the sole avenue to the senate, so as to dispense with the
revision of the list by the censors.<a id="FNanchor_2575" href="#Footnote_2575" class="fnanchor">[2575]</a> The statute of 151, forbidding
reëlection to the consulship,<a id="FNanchor_2576" href="#Footnote_2576" class="fnanchor">[2576]</a> he repealed, and substituted
for it the article of the Genucian plebiscite of 442<a id="FNanchor_2577" href="#Footnote_2577" class="fnanchor">[2577]</a> which
fixed an interval of ten years between the expiration of any
office and reëlection to the same.<a id="FNanchor_2578" href="#Footnote_2578" class="fnanchor">[2578]</a> He increased the number of
quaestors, at this time certainly more than eight,<a id="FNanchor_2579" href="#Footnote_2579" class="fnanchor">[2579]</a> to twenty, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
the object not only of supplying an administrative need but also
of creating the required number of senators.<a id="FNanchor_2580" href="#Footnote_2580" class="fnanchor">[2580]</a> It was necessary
also to raise the number of praetors from six to eight in order
to provide presidents for the new quaestiones perpetuae.<a id="FNanchor_2581" href="#Footnote_2581" class="fnanchor">[2581]</a></p>

<p>The reforms above mentioned, together with the doubling of
the number of senators to be considered below, naturally led to
the enlargement of the chief sacerdotal colleges. The augurs
and pontiffs were increased from nine to fifteen and the decemviri
sacris faciundis were made quindecemviri.<a id="FNanchor_2582" href="#Footnote_2582" class="fnanchor">[2582]</a> Another
measure, which seems to have been an article of the same act,
repealed the Domitian lex de sacerdotiis,<a id="FNanchor_2583" href="#Footnote_2583" class="fnanchor">[2583]</a> and thus restored to
these colleges, and at the same time to the epulones, their right
of filling vacancies by coöptation,<a id="FNanchor_2584" href="#Footnote_2584" class="fnanchor">[2584]</a> leaving to the people the
function only of electing the head of the pontifical college from
among the members.<a id="FNanchor_2585" href="#Footnote_2585" class="fnanchor">[2585]</a> As the object of the first article was
evidently to provide places for some of the new magistrates and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
senators,<a id="FNanchor_2586" href="#Footnote_2586" class="fnanchor">[2586]</a> the coöptation doubtless immediately followed the
enactment of the law.</p>

<p>In increasing the number of praetors to eight<a id="FNanchor_2587" href="#Footnote_2587" class="fnanchor">[2587]</a> Sulla provided
that during their year of office they were to remain in the city
and devote their whole time to the administration of justice.
After the expiration of their term they were to take upon themselves
as propraetors the command of provinces. In like manner
the consuls were to remain in Italy during their term, in the
ordinary course of events to give their entire attention to the
affairs of peace; only after they had retired from office were
they expected as proconsuls to govern provinces. In brief,
Sulla by law established an absolute distinction between the
civil magistrate and the military promagistrate.<a id="FNanchor_2588" href="#Footnote_2588" class="fnanchor">[2588]</a> The lex de
provinciis ordinandis<a id="FNanchor_2589" href="#Footnote_2589" class="fnanchor">[2589]</a> recognized the right of the senate to determine
which provinces should be consular and which pretorian
in the way provided for by the Sempronian law on this
subject.<a id="FNanchor_2590" href="#Footnote_2590" class="fnanchor">[2590]</a> The Cornelian statute did not, however, any more
than the Sempronian, forbid the assignment of a province to a
promagistrate by popular vote; and it recognized the right of
the senate to create promagistracies.<a id="FNanchor_2591" href="#Footnote_2591" class="fnanchor">[2591]</a> But it established the
rule (1) that the two consuls should receive for a year of promagisterial
imperium the provinces declared to be consular;
and that they should either agree as to which each should take
or cast lots for them;<a id="FNanchor_2592" href="#Footnote_2592" class="fnanchor">[2592]</a> (2) that the senate should annually assign
the eight retiring praetors to the remaining provinces, also
for a year of promagistracy.<a id="FNanchor_2593" href="#Footnote_2593" class="fnanchor">[2593]</a> The same law directed that the
promagistrate, who had received the imperium in legal form,
should retain it till his return to the city and the celebration of
his triumph,<a id="FNanchor_2594" href="#Footnote_2594" class="fnanchor">[2594]</a> provided he merited one. To avoid conflicts between
retiring and incoming governors it ordained that the former
should leave the province within thirty days after the latter
had entered it.<a id="FNanchor_2595" href="#Footnote_2595" class="fnanchor">[2595]</a> The law further contained the definite regulation
of the supplies and honors granted the legati by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
provincials.<a id="FNanchor_2596" href="#Footnote_2596" class="fnanchor">[2596]</a> The tendency of Sulla’s legislation thus far considered
was to weaken the civil functionaries (1) by restricting the tribunician
initiative. (2) by increasing the number of quaestors and
praetors. (3) by depriving the higher civil magistrates of the military
imperium. The last-mentioned loss was in some measure
an advantage to the senate but in a far higher degree to the
promagistrates, who from this time began to overshadow the
republic.</p>

<p>The power taken from the tribunes necessarily went to the
senate, to restore to it the full control of legislation which it
had possessed before the enactment of the Hortensian statute.
Under the reformed constitution it was to be supreme. As it
had dwindled during the recent civil war and proscription,<a id="FNanchor_2597" href="#Footnote_2597" class="fnanchor">[2597]</a> and
as the performance of jury service, which Sulla was restoring
to its members, required a large number of men, he added three
hundred, mostly from the equestrian rank, but including some
centurions and other insignificant persons who were likely to
do his bidding.<a id="FNanchor_2598" href="#Footnote_2598" class="fnanchor">[2598]</a> Appian<a id="FNanchor_2599" href="#Footnote_2599" class="fnanchor">[2599]</a> states that these new senators were
elected by the tribes, possibly meaning the tribal comitia.<a id="FNanchor_2600" href="#Footnote_2600" class="fnanchor">[2600]</a> But
as that process of selection would have required an enormous
length of time, it is far more probable that each tribe had the
privilege of choosing a definite number, perhaps nine, after the
precedent of the lex Plautia iudiciaria.<a id="FNanchor_2601" href="#Footnote_2601" class="fnanchor">[2601]</a> This addition would
raise the number to about four hundred and fifty. As the normal
membership from Sulla to Caesar was about six hundred,<a id="FNanchor_2602" href="#Footnote_2602" class="fnanchor">[2602]</a>
we may assume either that, independently of the extraordinary
adlectio by the tribes, he made the usual censorial enrolment of
the recently retired magistrates, or that he left it to time to fill
up the senate to the desired number by the annual admission of
retired quaestors.<a id="FNanchor_2603" href="#Footnote_2603" class="fnanchor">[2603]</a> Henceforth it was to be recruited automatically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
by this process, without any action on the part of the
censors, who were thus deprived of the only important function
remaining to them.<a id="FNanchor_2604" href="#Footnote_2604" class="fnanchor">[2604]</a> Closely connected with the increase in
membership is the lex iudiciaria,<a id="FNanchor_2605" href="#Footnote_2605" class="fnanchor">[2605]</a> which restored the quaestiones
to the senators.<a id="FNanchor_2606" href="#Footnote_2606" class="fnanchor">[2606]</a> It was enacted near the end of 81, but prior
to the increase in the number of quaestors.<a id="FNanchor_2607" href="#Footnote_2607" class="fnanchor">[2607]</a> Before this act
the courts had remained under the control of the knights in
spite of the lex Plautia of 89, which seems not to have continued
long in force.<a id="FNanchor_2608" href="#Footnote_2608" class="fnanchor">[2608]</a></p>

<p>In the reorganization of the criminal courts (year 81) Sulla
passed criminal laws, in which he regulated the procedure of
the existing courts and created new quaestiones perpetuae.<a id="FNanchor_2609" href="#Footnote_2609" class="fnanchor">[2609]</a>
His reform increased the number to seven, four of which
were concerned almost wholly with maladministration of office:
(1) quaestio repetundarum, extortion,<a id="FNanchor_2610" href="#Footnote_2610" class="fnanchor">[2610]</a> (2) quaestio ambitus, bribery
in elections,<a id="FNanchor_2611" href="#Footnote_2611" class="fnanchor">[2611]</a> (3) quaestio peculatus, misappropriation of public
funds<a id="FNanchor_2612" href="#Footnote_2612" class="fnanchor">[2612]</a> and sacrilege,<a id="FNanchor_2613" href="#Footnote_2613" class="fnanchor">[2613]</a> (4) quaestio maiestatis, injury to the
majesty of the Roman name, of which a private person as well
as a magistrate might be guilty.<a id="FNanchor_2614" href="#Footnote_2614" class="fnanchor">[2614]</a> The three following were
concerned with common crimes: (5) quaestio inter sicarios et<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
veneficos, assassination, poisoning, and arson,<a id="FNanchor_2615" href="#Footnote_2615" class="fnanchor">[2615]</a> (6) quaestio de
falsis, counterfeiting and falsification of testaments and other
forgery,<a id="FNanchor_2616" href="#Footnote_2616" class="fnanchor">[2616]</a> (7) quaestio iniuriarum, acute personal violence, housebreaking,
and probably defamation of character.<a id="FNanchor_2617" href="#Footnote_2617" class="fnanchor">[2617]</a> These laws
concerning quaestiones contained provisions for granting the
accused the privilege of deciding whether the vote should be
oral or by ballot,<a id="FNanchor_2618" href="#Footnote_2618" class="fnanchor">[2618]</a> and they directed that the order of voting
should be determined by lot.<a id="FNanchor_2619" href="#Footnote_2619" class="fnanchor">[2619]</a> The first of these two articles
aimed to make the jurors individually responsible, and the
second to prevent influential men from prejudicing the case by
giving their opinions first.<a id="FNanchor_2620" href="#Footnote_2620" class="fnanchor">[2620]</a></p>

<p>While the praetor urbanus and praetor peregrinus still busied
themselves with civil jurisdiction, the six other praetors presided
over these courts; but as the number was insufficient, past
aediles were appointed to preside as iudices quaestionis. This
arrangement was especially necessary for the quaestio inter
sicarios, overburdened as it was with a variety of crimes.</p>

<p>As these courts were vested with the function of trying without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
appeal all crimes, including those formerly brought before
the comitia, the result was that the people were practically,
though not constitutionally, deprived of their judicial power.
The tendency of the Cornelian legislation in this as in other
respects was oligarchic.</p>

<p>Among the statutes passed in the winter or early spring of
81 we must place the lex de proscriptione,<a id="FNanchor_2621" href="#Footnote_2621" class="fnanchor">[2621]</a> which added certain
regulations to those of the Valerian law for the creation of the
Cornelian dictatorship,<a id="FNanchor_2622" href="#Footnote_2622" class="fnanchor">[2622]</a> and which Sulla considered essential to
the execution of his policy and the maintenance of its results.
The Cornelian statute concerning proscription forbade the giving
of relief or aid to a proscribed person;<a id="FNanchor_2623" href="#Footnote_2623" class="fnanchor">[2623]</a> it legalized the
previous slayings and confiscations of property,<a id="FNanchor_2624" href="#Footnote_2624" class="fnanchor">[2624]</a> and provided
also that the estates not only of the proscribed but also of enemies
who had fallen in battle should be sold for the benefit of
the treasury.<a id="FNanchor_2625" href="#Footnote_2625" class="fnanchor">[2625]</a> It excepted from the sale ten thousand of the
youngest and strongest slaves, who were given their freedom;
and it debarred from the ius honorum the sons, grandsons, and
other descendants of the proscribed,<a id="FNanchor_2626" href="#Footnote_2626" class="fnanchor">[2626]</a> with a view to keeping
from them the means of vengeance; and lastly, it fixed the date
for closing the proscriptions at June 1, 81.<a id="FNanchor_2627" href="#Footnote_2627" class="fnanchor">[2627]</a></p>

<p>During the winter of 82-81 Sulla gave his attention not only
to law-making but also to the sale of confiscated property and
to the regulation of Italy. The latter work was carried out by
the administrative power of the dictator through the destruction
of the fortifications of rebellious communities, their punishment
by fines and extraordinary taxes, and the confiscation of some of
their lands, to be assigned to his discharged veterans.<a id="FNanchor_2628" href="#Footnote_2628" class="fnanchor">[2628]</a> The
Cornelian agrarian laws,<a id="FNanchor_2629" href="#Footnote_2629" class="fnanchor">[2629]</a> which brought about these confiscations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
and assignments, seem to have been not acts of the comitia but
dictatorial orders.<a id="FNanchor_2630" href="#Footnote_2630" class="fnanchor">[2630]</a> They must have been issued from time to
time as occasion demanded, probably through the entire year
81.<a id="FNanchor_2631" href="#Footnote_2631" class="fnanchor">[2631]</a> The legions were kept together till after the triumph (January
27, 28 of the year 81)<a id="FNanchor_2632" href="#Footnote_2632" class="fnanchor">[2632]</a> and then disbanded, to be led off
gradually to their lands. Some of the municipia to which soldiers
were assigned, most obstinately Volaterrae and Nola, resisted
their admission by force of arms. To punish these rebels
Sulla carried through the comitia centuriata his lex de civitate
Volaterranis adimenda,<a id="FNanchor_2633" href="#Footnote_2633" class="fnanchor">[2633]</a> which disfranchised not only Volaterrae
but also other rebellious municipia.<a id="FNanchor_2634" href="#Footnote_2634" class="fnanchor">[2634]</a> Those who by this act
were deprived of the citizenship received the so-called Latin
rights of Ariminum.<a id="FNanchor_2635" href="#Footnote_2635" class="fnanchor">[2635]</a></p>

<p>Among the regulations for the improvement of the finances,
which he found in bad condition,<a id="FNanchor_2636" href="#Footnote_2636" class="fnanchor">[2636]</a> was his abolition of the distributions
of grain.<a id="FNanchor_2637" href="#Footnote_2637" class="fnanchor">[2637]</a> Whether it was effected by a lex frumentaria
or a dictatorial order cannot be determined.<a id="FNanchor_2638" href="#Footnote_2638" class="fnanchor">[2638]</a> The levy of
taxes on Italian and transmarine communities<a id="FNanchor_2639" href="#Footnote_2639" class="fnanchor">[2639]</a> could be brought
about by senatus consulta,<a id="FNanchor_2640" href="#Footnote_2640" class="fnanchor">[2640]</a> as the people had nothing to do with
such matters. Credit had been shattered by the law of L. Valerius
Flaccus concerning debts, 86,<a id="FNanchor_2641" href="#Footnote_2641" class="fnanchor">[2641]</a> which Sulla repealed by one
of his own on the same subject, 81.<a id="FNanchor_2642" href="#Footnote_2642" class="fnanchor">[2642]</a></p>

<p>In connection with the Circensian games which he celebrated
in the autumn of 81, and which in honor of Victoria were thereafter
repeated annually from October 26 to November 1,<a id="FNanchor_2643" href="#Footnote_2643" class="fnanchor">[2643]</a> Sulla<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
must have passed a lex de ludis Victoriae instituendis.<a id="FNanchor_2644" href="#Footnote_2644" class="fnanchor">[2644]</a> Lastly
came the sumptuary law, through which he attempted to regulate
the manners and morals of the citizens.<a id="FNanchor_2645" href="#Footnote_2645" class="fnanchor">[2645]</a> It was the restoration,
in a revised form, of the lex Licinia of 104,<a id="FNanchor_2646" href="#Footnote_2646" class="fnanchor">[2646]</a> which had
been repealed by M. Duronius in 97.<a id="FNanchor_2647" href="#Footnote_2647" class="fnanchor">[2647]</a> The Cornelian statute
permitted the expenditure of no more than three hundred
sesterces for meals on the calends, nones, ides, ludi, and certain
other holidays, and only thirty for ordinary meals; and it fixed
the prices of various luxuries.<a id="FNanchor_2648" href="#Footnote_2648" class="fnanchor">[2648]</a> Another article of the same
statute limited funeral expenses.<a id="FNanchor_2649" href="#Footnote_2649" class="fnanchor">[2649]</a> The author’s object seems to
have been to restore the morals and manners as well as the constitution
and laws of the good old time before they were corrupted
by the demagogues.</p>

<p>Sulla’s legislation was substantially complete on January 1, 80,
when he entered upon his second consulship with Q. Caecilius
Metellus Pius as colleague.<a id="FNanchor_2650" href="#Footnote_2650" class="fnanchor">[2650]</a> Retiring into private life early in
79, he left the constitution to its fate. No better comment on
its value could be offered than the history of its decline and overthrow
in a single decade. Opposition began to manifest itself
from the time of his abdication; and he was hardly in his grave
when M. Aemilius Lepidus, consul in 78, promulgated bills for
the abolition of some of the Cornelian statutes; but the opposition
of his colleague, Q. Lutatius Catulus, and of the senate
prevented their ratification.<a id="FNanchor_2651" href="#Footnote_2651" class="fnanchor">[2651]</a> The right of retired tribunes to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
sue for other offices,<a id="FNanchor_2652" href="#Footnote_2652" class="fnanchor">[2652]</a> however, was restored by a statute of the
consul C. Aurelius Cotta, 75.<a id="FNanchor_2653" href="#Footnote_2653" class="fnanchor">[2653]</a></p>

<p>Before coming to the restoration of the tribunician power it
is necessary to mention the statutes passed under the Cornelian
constitution. To 78 or 77 probably belongs the lex Plautia de
vi, generally regarded as tribunician, which established a quaestio
perpetua for the trial of persons charged with violence. It
also forbade the acquisition by long use of things stolen or violently
seized.<a id="FNanchor_2654" href="#Footnote_2654" class="fnanchor">[2654]</a> As no censors were elected, an order of the
people of unknown authorship in 75, pursuant to a senatus consultum,
empowered the consuls of the year to farm the vectigalia.<a id="FNanchor_2655" href="#Footnote_2655" class="fnanchor">[2655]</a>
The approaching end of the Cornelian régime was
foreboded in the Plautian law for the recall of Cinna and other
exiled democrats, if indeed this measure belongs to 73,<a id="FNanchor_2656" href="#Footnote_2656" class="fnanchor">[2656]</a> and
certainly in the consular law of Cn. Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus,
72, which directed the consuls of the year to collect the
money remitted by Sulla to the purchasers of confiscated estates.<a id="FNanchor_2657" href="#Footnote_2657" class="fnanchor">[2657]</a>
A popular tendency may be discovered as well in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
final settlement of the question of conflict between sessions of
the senate and of the comitia by the lex Pupia, which seems to
have been a statute of M. Pupius Piso Calpurnianus, praetor in
71.<a id="FNanchor_2658" href="#Footnote_2658" class="fnanchor">[2658]</a> It forbade the magistrates to convoke the senate on those
comitial days on which an assembly actually met,<a id="FNanchor_2659" href="#Footnote_2659" class="fnanchor">[2659]</a> the prohibition
applying to that part only of the day which preceded the
dismissal of the comitia.<a id="FNanchor_2660" href="#Footnote_2660" class="fnanchor">[2660]</a> It was probably this year which saw
the enactment of the lex Antonia de Termessibus—a plebiscite
proposed de senatus sententia by C. Antonius, tribune of the
plebs, and several of his colleagues, for granting to Termessus
Major in Pisidia the rights of a free state in friendship and alliance
with Rome, and for regulating on that basis the relations
which were to exist between the inhabitants and the Romans.<a id="FNanchor_2661" href="#Footnote_2661" class="fnanchor">[2661]</a></p>

<p>The struggle for the rehabilitation of the tribunes began in
78, when those officials applied to the consuls for legislation on
the subject. Even Aemilius Lepidus<a id="FNanchor_2662" href="#Footnote_2662" class="fnanchor">[2662]</a> declined, as he could see
no advantage in the unhampered tribunate.<a id="FNanchor_2663" href="#Footnote_2663" class="fnanchor">[2663]</a> Though generally
in these early years of the Cornelian régime the tribunes were
mere puppets of the senate, one of them in 76, L. Sicinius,
dared in a contio to plead for the full restoration of their office.<a id="FNanchor_2664" href="#Footnote_2664" class="fnanchor">[2664]</a>
In the following year Q. Opimius, another tribune, continued
the struggle, with such success that he secured the passage of
the Aurelian law above mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_2665" href="#Footnote_2665" class="fnanchor">[2665]</a> This measure narrowly
escaped annulment, and Opimius after retiring from office was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
exorbitantly fined on the ground that he had interceded in violation
of a Cornelian law.<a id="FNanchor_2666" href="#Footnote_2666" class="fnanchor">[2666]</a> In the year of the condemnation of
Opimius, 74, L. Quinctius, who had risen to the tribunate from
the lowest social class, strove energetically for the same object,<a id="FNanchor_2667" href="#Footnote_2667" class="fnanchor">[2667]</a>
though he could effect no more than the maintenance of the
Aurelian law. Toward the close of his term, however, he opened
battle against the senatorial courts, which had fallen into disfavor
because of their corruption.<a id="FNanchor_2668" href="#Footnote_2668" class="fnanchor">[2668]</a> In 73 the contest was resumed by
Licinius Macer the annalist, then tribune of the plebs, who demanded
in vain the full restoration of the tribunician power.<a id="FNanchor_2669" href="#Footnote_2669" class="fnanchor">[2669]</a> In
his efforts he had the support of C. Julius Caesar.<a id="FNanchor_2670" href="#Footnote_2670" class="fnanchor">[2670]</a> The struggle
died down as the danger from Spartacus rose; but at the close
of the servile war it was a tribune of the plebs, M. Lollius Palicanus,
a man of low birth, who in a contio held outside the walls
in order that Pompey, a proconsul, might attend, persuaded the
latter to commit himself publicly to a definite promise to bring
about a repeal of the lex Cornelia de tribunicia potestate.<a id="FNanchor_2671" href="#Footnote_2671" class="fnanchor">[2671]</a> Inveighing
against the corruption of the senatorial courts,<a id="FNanchor_2672" href="#Footnote_2672" class="fnanchor">[2672]</a> Pompey
in the same speech intimated an intention to propose a bill
on this subject as well.</p>

<p>Shortly after entering upon the office of consul in 70, or at all
events before the elections of the year,<a id="FNanchor_2673" href="#Footnote_2673" class="fnanchor">[2673]</a> Pompey promulgated
his rogation for the restoration of the tribunician power.
The senate yielded in spite of its dislike for the measure,<a id="FNanchor_2674" href="#Footnote_2674" class="fnanchor">[2674]</a> and
Licinius Crassus, his colleague,<a id="FNanchor_2675" href="#Footnote_2675" class="fnanchor">[2675]</a> added his name to the proposal.<a id="FNanchor_2676" href="#Footnote_2676" class="fnanchor">[2676]</a>
The people gladly accepted it. Those articles of the
Cornelian statute which remained untouched by the Aurelian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
law of 75 were thereby repealed, and every restriction on the
tribunes removed.<a id="FNanchor_2677" href="#Footnote_2677" class="fnanchor">[2677]</a> By destroying the chief support of the
Cornelian constitution this measure paved the way to its overthrow.
Notwithstanding the popular clamor for a reform of
the courts,<a id="FNanchor_2678" href="#Footnote_2678" class="fnanchor">[2678]</a> Pompey hesitated to propose a law for that purpose,
as he hoped rather to purify the senatorial order through a
severe censorial revision so as to make a judiciary law unnecessary.
The reform, however, was taken in hand by L. Aurelius
Cotta, praetor in the same year, youngest brother of the consul
of 75.<a id="FNanchor_2679" href="#Footnote_2679" class="fnanchor">[2679]</a> The rogation was promulgated while the trial of
Verres was in progress and while the people were excited by
lack of confidence in the senatorial jurors.<a id="FNanchor_2680" href="#Footnote_2680" class="fnanchor">[2680]</a> The first project
seems to have been the retransfer of the courts to the equites;<a id="FNanchor_2681" href="#Footnote_2681" class="fnanchor">[2681]</a>
but when the senators saw that they were destined to lose in
the contest, they were able to save something by compromise.
It was agreed that there should be three decuries of jurors, composed
in equal numbers of senators, knights, and tribuni aerarii
respectively.<a id="FNanchor_2682" href="#Footnote_2682" class="fnanchor">[2682]</a> The last-named decury was included because
the Plautian judiciary law of 89 had opened the courts to common
citizens in addition to senators and knights,<a id="FNanchor_2683" href="#Footnote_2683" class="fnanchor">[2683]</a> and it was
now thought that no less liberality should be shown. The
Aurelian statute provided accordingly that the urban praetor<a id="FNanchor_2684" href="#Footnote_2684" class="fnanchor">[2684]</a>
should make up the annual album iudicum of an equal number
of men from each of the three classes.<a id="FNanchor_2685" href="#Footnote_2685" class="fnanchor">[2685]</a> The good feature of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
the law is obvious. As experience had proved the equestrian
courts, as well as the senatorial, to be partisan and corrupt, it
was hoped that a combination of the two with an equal proportion
of the most responsible and respectable common citizens
would be just and impartial. If these expectations were
not realized, it was the fault of the Romans, not of their law.</p>

<h4>II. <i>Democracy in Alliance with Caesarism</i><br />
70-49</h4>

<p>The first tribunician law under the restored constitution may
have been the sumptuary statute of C. Antius Restio, which
Lange<a id="FNanchor_2686" href="#Footnote_2686" class="fnanchor">[2686]</a> assigns to the year 70. It limited the amount to be
expended on festive meals; it designated some delicacies as
allowable and others as forbidden; and it regulated the participation
of candidates and of magistrates in dinners away from
home, doubtless with a view to curtailing ambitus practiced by
such means.<a id="FNanchor_2687" href="#Footnote_2687" class="fnanchor">[2687]</a> Far however from being a partisan measure,
this statute seems to have been suggested by the censors of
the year, to reënforce their function of supervising the morals
of the citizens.</p>

<p>Three years passed before the tribunes of the plebs were
ready to make independent use of their recovered power. The
reason is to be found in the harmony—concordia ordinum<a id="FNanchor_2688" href="#Footnote_2688" class="fnanchor">[2688]</a>—reëstablished
between senators and knights, when representatives
of the two classes found themselves sitting together on the
jury benches. Although the object of the combination was
idealized by contemporaries, it was in fact a governing “trust,”
which in practice operated for the maintenance of plutocracy
and for the ruthless exploitation of the provincials.<a id="FNanchor_2689" href="#Footnote_2689" class="fnanchor">[2689]</a> The nobles
were willing to concede something to the equites to make
permanent the alliance with this powerful order.<a id="FNanchor_2690" href="#Footnote_2690" class="fnanchor">[2690]</a> L. Roscius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span>
Otho, tribune of the plebs in 67, as spokesman of the optimates<a id="FNanchor_2691" href="#Footnote_2691" class="fnanchor">[2691]</a>
“railroaded”<a id="FNanchor_2692" href="#Footnote_2692" class="fnanchor">[2692]</a> through the assembly a statute which
ordered that there should be reserved in the theatre for those
in possession of the equestrian census<a id="FNanchor_2693" href="#Footnote_2693" class="fnanchor">[2693]</a> fourteen rows of seats
just back of the orchestra, in which sat the senators.<a id="FNanchor_2694" href="#Footnote_2694" class="fnanchor">[2694]</a> It was
more than a restoration of the concession made to the knights
in 146, which evidently Sulla had withdrawn.<a id="FNanchor_2695" href="#Footnote_2695" class="fnanchor">[2695]</a></p>

<p>There were in this year (67), however, two popular tribunes,
A. Gabinius and C. Cornelius, both of whom proposed and
carried laws in the interest of the people. Early in the year
Gabinius persuaded the tribes to adopt a statute which ordered
the senate to sit daily during February to consider embassies.<a id="FNanchor_2696" href="#Footnote_2696" class="fnanchor">[2696]</a>
It was in this month that delegations from other states generally
came. Often to obtain a hearing they had to bribe the
senators and magistrates.<a id="FNanchor_2697" href="#Footnote_2697" class="fnanchor">[2697]</a> For that month the Gabinian law
reversed the Pupian<a id="FNanchor_2698" href="#Footnote_2698" class="fnanchor">[2698]</a> by making senatorial sessions compulsory
and forbidding the concurrence of comitia.<a id="FNanchor_2699" href="#Footnote_2699" class="fnanchor">[2699]</a> The object was to
limit the stay of foreign embassies at Rome not only for their
own convenience but also for lessening both the need and the
opportunity for bribery. Closely related was the purpose of his
statute which forbade lending money to provincials at Rome.<a id="FNanchor_2700" href="#Footnote_2700" class="fnanchor">[2700]</a>
Representatives of subject and allied states, finding it necessary
to bribe more extensively than their resources in hand allowed,
were tempted to borrow of the capitalists at exorbitant interest.
Private individuals from the provinces must often have similarly
borrowed to the ruin of their fortunes. The double aim of the
statute, accordingly, was to help the provincials and to check
bribery. How it passed against senatorial opposition is unknown.
A supplementary measure on the same subject was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
proposed to the senate by C. Cornelius, a colleague of Gabinius,
for prohibiting the lending of money to the legati of other states,
the idea being identical with that of the two Gabinian laws.
The good intention of Cornelius is vouched for by the well-known
uprightness<a id="FNanchor_2701" href="#Footnote_2701" class="fnanchor">[2701]</a> of his character, which contrasts with the
reputed vileness of Gabinius. But the senate rejected the proposal
on the ground that it had already made sufficient provision
for checking the abuse. Although Cornelius thereupon
complained in a contio that the provinces were being exhausted
by usury, he does not seem to have urged his measure further.<a id="FNanchor_2702" href="#Footnote_2702" class="fnanchor">[2702]</a>
He promulgated, however, against the interests of the senate a
rogation for ordering that no one should receive a dispensation
from a law excepting through a vote of the comitia. This right
had been acquired by the people in the period between the
Publilian and the Hortensian legislation (339-287).<a id="FNanchor_2703" href="#Footnote_2703" class="fnanchor">[2703]</a> It had
come to be regarded as inseparable from the sovereignty of the
people to such an extent that all senatus consulta for dispensing
from the laws contained a provision for bringing the matter
before the comitia. Gradually the custom of referring to the
people ceased, and at last the provision to that effect was
dropped from senatorial decrees. The result was that often a
few senators, meeting in the Curia, voted away to acquaintances
and relatives the valuable privilege of exemption from a law.
The optimates induced a tribune of the plebs, P. Servilius
Globulus, to intercede against the bill while it was being read to
the assembly prior to the vote. When the dissenting tribune
forbade the crier to proceed with the reading, Cornelius himself
read it.<a id="FNanchor_2704" href="#Footnote_2704" class="fnanchor">[2704]</a> A disturbance in the assembly, started by the interference
of Piso the consul, caused Cornelius to dismiss the concilium.
Afterward he so compromised with the optimates as to
secure the passage of a law that no dispensations should be
granted by the senate unless two hundred members were present,
and that when a resolution of the kind was brought down
from the senate to the people, no one should intercede against
the act.<a id="FNanchor_2705" href="#Footnote_2705" class="fnanchor">[2705]</a> The victory was with the senate; it gained a legal
right to a function which it had usurped, provision being merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
made against abuse. But it exercised this function by the sufferance
of the tribunes, any one of whom could insist on bringing
the dispensing resolution before the people, in which case
his colleagues were forbidden to intercede.<a id="FNanchor_2706" href="#Footnote_2706" class="fnanchor">[2706]</a></p>

<p>Another proposal of this tribune was the rogatio de ambitu,
which threatened with severe penalties not only the candidates
but also their agents, the divisores, whose duty was to distribute
the corruption fund among the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_2707" href="#Footnote_2707" class="fnanchor">[2707]</a> The senate, declaring
the penalties so harsh that neither accuser nor jurors could be
found to enforce it, put the bill in the hands of the two consuls,
C. Calpurnius Piso and M’. Acilius Glabrio.<a id="FNanchor_2708" href="#Footnote_2708" class="fnanchor">[2708]</a> Here was a comical
situation; both consuls were liable to the existing law on
the subject; but for the sake of appearances they had to revise
the bill and present it to the comitia in the Forum.<a id="FNanchor_2709" href="#Footnote_2709" class="fnanchor">[2709]</a> The lex
Acilia Calpurnia, enacted in this way,<a id="FNanchor_2710" href="#Footnote_2710" class="fnanchor">[2710]</a> inflicted on those found
guilty of the crime a heavy fine, and forever disqualified them
from holding office or sitting in the senate.<a id="FNanchor_2711" href="#Footnote_2711" class="fnanchor">[2711]</a> Cornelius proposed
other measures, all of which were vetoed by colleagues
excepting his lex concerning the edict of the praetor, described
as follows by Dio Cassius:<a id="FNanchor_2712" href="#Footnote_2712" class="fnanchor">[2712]</a> “All the praetors themselves compiled
and published the principles according to which they intended
to try cases; for all the decrees regarding contracts had
not yet been laid down. Now since they were not in the habit
of doing this once for all and did not observe the rules as written,
but often made changes in them and incidentally a number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
of clauses naturally appeared in some one’s favor or to some one’s
hurt, he moved that they should at the very start announce the
principles they would use and not swerve from them at all.”
The object was to make the administration of the law more just
and regular, and to cut off an opportunity for favoritism.<a id="FNanchor_2713" href="#Footnote_2713" class="fnanchor">[2713]</a></p>

<p>By far the most important measure of the year was the
Gabinian law for the appointment of an especial commander
against the pirates. The proposition was that from the consulares
should be chosen a general for putting down the
pirates; that his province should be the entire Mediterranean
and a strip of its coasts extending fifty miles inland, including
Italy and the islands; that the command should continue three
years; that the holder of this imperium should have the right
to fifteen legati and 200 ships, and the privilege of enlisting
soldiers and oarsmen over all his province; that he should have
credit with the aerarium at Rome and the publicans in the provinces
for 6000 talents.<a id="FNanchor_2714" href="#Footnote_2714" class="fnanchor">[2714]</a> The name of Pompey did not appear
in the bill, but no one doubted who was to be the man. The
optimates were all opposed, though in 74 they had given Antonius
such a command,<a id="FNanchor_2715" href="#Footnote_2715" class="fnanchor">[2715]</a> which now served Gabinius as a precedent.
The senate was compelled by threats of the people to
yield, but used its influence on the colleagues of Gabinius to
have them oppose the measure. Two of them, L. Roscius Otho,
author of the lex theatralis,<a id="FNanchor_2716" href="#Footnote_2716" class="fnanchor">[2716]</a> and L. Trebellius, attempted to
prevent comitial action. The tribes began to vote the deposition
of Trebellius; but before the eighteenth was called he
desisted.<a id="FNanchor_2717" href="#Footnote_2717" class="fnanchor">[2717]</a> Thereafter both remained silent, and the law was
passed. Pompey was then elected to the command by the
tribes.<a id="FNanchor_2718" href="#Footnote_2718" class="fnanchor">[2718]</a> They enacted further that he should have two quaestors,
twenty-four legati pro praetore, 500 ships, 120,000 men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
and 5000 cavalry. On one point only the senate refused its
sanction; it would not permit Gabinius to be a legatus.<a id="FNanchor_2719" href="#Footnote_2719" class="fnanchor">[2719]</a> An
article of the statute gave as a province to the outgoing consul,
M’. Acilius Glabrio, Bithynia and Pontus with the conduct of the
war against Mithridates.<a id="FNanchor_2720" href="#Footnote_2720" class="fnanchor">[2720]</a> The Gabinian law led to far-reaching
consequences. It established temporarily, not precisely a
monarchy, but a dyarchy, as the Roman world was thereby
divided between the senate and a general with almost absolute
power. The arrangement was a prototype of the Augustan
system. At the outset the act seemed to be justified by the
results, for immediately after its adoption the price of grain fell
from the famine height to which the piratical control of the
seas had forced it.<a id="FNanchor_2721" href="#Footnote_2721" class="fnanchor">[2721]</a></p>

<p>An addition to this vast power was made in the following
year by the Manilian law. The author, C. Manilius, after
entering upon his tribunate on December 10, 67, promulgated
a rogation for giving libertini the right to vote in the tribes of
their patrons.<a id="FNanchor_2722" href="#Footnote_2722" class="fnanchor">[2722]</a> It was said by some, though probably without
ground, that the real author was Cornelius.<a id="FNanchor_2723" href="#Footnote_2723" class="fnanchor">[2723]</a> While in general
the optimates disliked the measure, some favored it in the hope
that they would gain political influence through the votes of
their freedmen.<a id="FNanchor_2724" href="#Footnote_2724" class="fnanchor">[2724]</a> In spite of the fact that constitutionally the
comitia could not be held on a festive day, Manilius convoked
the assembly on the last day of the year, which was the Compitalia,
toward evening, gathering to the assembly a few men
who he knew favored the proposal. On the following day
the senate heard of the enactment and at once declared it invalid.<a id="FNanchor_2725" href="#Footnote_2725" class="fnanchor">[2725]</a>
The behavior of Manilius exposed him to certain prosecution
unless he could win powerful support. This is the
motive ascribed to him by Dio Cassius<a id="FNanchor_2726" href="#Footnote_2726" class="fnanchor">[2726]</a> for his famous law<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
which conferred extraordinary power on Pompey for the conduct
of the war against Mithridates.<a id="FNanchor_2727" href="#Footnote_2727" class="fnanchor">[2727]</a> It gave the Roman general,
in addition to his existing command, the provinces of Asia,
Bithynia, and Cilicia with the right to declare war and make
treaties at his discretion.<a id="FNanchor_2728" href="#Footnote_2728" class="fnanchor">[2728]</a> The province thus granted him included
nearly all the eastern domain of Rome which had not
already been conferred by the Gabinian law. No discussion of
this measure in the senate is mentioned, though it is difficult to
understand how such action could be avoided.<a id="FNanchor_2729" href="#Footnote_2729" class="fnanchor">[2729]</a> The only
optimates who opposed the bill in contiones were Q. Lutatius
Catulus and Q. Hortensius, who had been the chief opponents
of the Gabinian law. Their objection was the monarchical
position in which these measures were placing Pompey.<a id="FNanchor_2730" href="#Footnote_2730" class="fnanchor">[2730]</a> Its
leading supporters were Caesar and Cicero.<a id="FNanchor_2731" href="#Footnote_2731" class="fnanchor">[2731]</a> It was so enthusiastically
favored by the knights and the populace that its
adoption was from the beginning a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>In 65 the conservatives found themselves strong enough to
put through the assembly the plebiscite of C. Papius for expelling
the peregrini from Rome, and for punishing those who had
usurped the rights of the citizens. The object was to prevent
Latin-speaking foreigners, especially the Transpadane Gauls,
from packing the assemblies with a view to passing measures
for the further extension of the franchise. The Papian law
was modelled after the Claudian of 177,<a id="FNanchor_2732" href="#Footnote_2732" class="fnanchor">[2732]</a> the Junian of 126,<a id="FNanchor_2733" href="#Footnote_2733" class="fnanchor">[2733]</a>
and in some respects after the Licinian-Mucian of 95.<a id="FNanchor_2734" href="#Footnote_2734" class="fnanchor">[2734]</a> Probably
to the same Papius belongs the lex Papia de Vestalium
lectione, which limited the power of choice exercised by the
supreme pontiff.<a id="FNanchor_2735" href="#Footnote_2735" class="fnanchor">[2735]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span></p>

<p>After the unusual comitial activity of 67-66 there was almost
a pause in legislation till the year of Cicero’s consulship, 63.
To that date belongs the plebiscite of T. Atius Labienus,
which restored the form of election of sacerdotes introduced
by Domitius in 103<a id="FNanchor_2736" href="#Footnote_2736" class="fnanchor">[2736]</a> and abolished by Sulla.<a id="FNanchor_2737" href="#Footnote_2737" class="fnanchor">[2737]</a></p>

<p>A remarkable effort at agrarian legislation was made at the
beginning of the year by P. Servilius Rullus, tribune of the
plebs. In December, 64, shortly after entering office, he promulgated
a bill, comprising more than forty articles,<a id="FNanchor_2738" href="#Footnote_2738" class="fnanchor">[2738]</a> with the
intention of having it voted on in January.<a id="FNanchor_2739" href="#Footnote_2739" class="fnanchor">[2739]</a> The administration
of the law was to be in the hands of ten men elected by
seventeen tribes after the manner of the comitia pontificis
maximi,<a id="FNanchor_2740" href="#Footnote_2740" class="fnanchor">[2740]</a> to hold office five years.<a id="FNanchor_2741" href="#Footnote_2741" class="fnanchor">[2741]</a> Candidates should be
required to present themselves in person<a id="FNanchor_2742" href="#Footnote_2742" class="fnanchor">[2742]</a> (so as to exclude
Pompey). This commission was to have the irresponsible<a id="FNanchor_2743" href="#Footnote_2743" class="fnanchor">[2743]</a>
management of large resources<a id="FNanchor_2744" href="#Footnote_2744" class="fnanchor">[2744]</a> for the purchase of land in
Italy,<a id="FNanchor_2745" href="#Footnote_2745" class="fnanchor">[2745]</a> on which they were to plant colonies at their discretion.<a id="FNanchor_2746" href="#Footnote_2746" class="fnanchor">[2746]</a>
The object of the rogation seems to have been the creation of
an oligarchy of ten who with their vast powers and revenues
should control Rome and counterbalance the military prestige
of Pompey. Caesar and Crassus were probably behind the
scheme. Should it by any chance succeed, they would be
the dominant members of the board. Its faulty structure and
revolutionary demands, however, made failure almost certain
from the outset. At all events Cicero, driven into the ranks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
of the optimates by the necessity of opposing it,—so Caesar
may have reasoned,—would thus be eliminated from the
leadership of the democratic party, while the populace, with
appetite whetted for an agrarian law, would be ready for the
saner measure which Caesar was himself intending to propose
as soon as an opportunity offered. But Cicero out-manoeuvred
his adversaries. It was as a friend of the people and an ally of
the tribunes that he opposed the bill in two contiones,<a id="FNanchor_2747" href="#Footnote_2747" class="fnanchor">[2747]</a> after
which a threat of intercession on the part of a colleague induced
Rullus to withdraw it.</p>

<p>In Cicero’s judgment there was pressing need of a new lex
de ambitu to cover the loopholes left by the Acilian-Calpurnian
statute of 67.<a id="FNanchor_2748" href="#Footnote_2748" class="fnanchor">[2748]</a> Early in the year he passed through the senate
a decree which so interpreted that enactment as to make it
apply to the hiring of sectatores, the granting of free seats
to the tribes at gladiatorial shows, and the entertainment of
the public at dinners.<a id="FNanchor_2749" href="#Footnote_2749" class="fnanchor">[2749]</a> Later in the summer, after the elections
of the year had been announced, a dispensation from
the Aelian-Fufian law<a id="FNanchor_2750" href="#Footnote_2750" class="fnanchor">[2750]</a> enabled him and C. Antonius, his colleague,<a id="FNanchor_2751" href="#Footnote_2751" class="fnanchor">[2751]</a>
to propose and carry a new statute concerning bribery
at elections.<a id="FNanchor_2752" href="#Footnote_2752" class="fnanchor">[2752]</a> It increased the penalty on the divisores,<a id="FNanchor_2753" href="#Footnote_2753" class="fnanchor">[2753]</a> and
forbade any one within the two years preceding the announcement
of a candidacy to give gladiatorial shows excepting in
fulfilment of a testament.<a id="FNanchor_2754" href="#Footnote_2754" class="fnanchor">[2754]</a> The penalty for the convicted candidate
was ten years’ exile.<a id="FNanchor_2755" href="#Footnote_2755" class="fnanchor">[2755]</a> The part of the law which had to
do with the jurors included a provision for fining those who
absented themselves from the trial even on the ground of
illness.<a id="FNanchor_2756" href="#Footnote_2756" class="fnanchor">[2756]</a> A measure certainly passed in this year, and probably
forming an article of the Tullian lex de ambitu, forbade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
candidacies in absentia.<a id="FNanchor_2757" href="#Footnote_2757" class="fnanchor">[2757]</a> Amid the troubles connected with
the Catilinarian conspiracy Cicero found time for an attempt
to relieve the provincials of one of the most flagrant abuses
inflicted on them by the senatorial oligarchy. To increase
the dignity and lessen the expense of a member while travelling
even on private business through the provinces, the senate
was accustomed to have the office of public legatus conferred
on him by a magistrate, which honor at the same time implied
the right to be absent from sessions of the senate.<a id="FNanchor_2758" href="#Footnote_2758" class="fnanchor">[2758]</a> In this
capacity a senator represented the state,<a id="FNanchor_2759" href="#Footnote_2759" class="fnanchor">[2759]</a> and could have lictors
assigned him by the provincial governors.<a id="FNanchor_2760" href="#Footnote_2760" class="fnanchor">[2760]</a> Abuses of this
privilege were to the provincials an especially vexatious form
of oppression.<a id="FNanchor_2761" href="#Footnote_2761" class="fnanchor">[2761]</a> Cicero’s first rogation on the subject proposed
to abolish the free legation, but when a tribune in the service of
the illiberals interceded, the measure before enactment was so
weakened as to limit the privilege of any one person to a single
year,<a id="FNanchor_2762" href="#Footnote_2762" class="fnanchor">[2762]</a> and hence did little to remedy the mischief.<a id="FNanchor_2763" href="#Footnote_2763" class="fnanchor">[2763]</a> There was
in fact no hope for the provincials either from the avaricious
plutocrats or the hungry proletarians.</p>

<p>The legislation of the years between the consulships of Cicero
and Caesar, 63-59, involved no important principle. To prevent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
the introduction of forged statutes in the archives,<a id="FNanchor_2764" href="#Footnote_2764" class="fnanchor">[2764]</a> a law
of D. Junius Silanus and L. Licinius Murena, consuls in 62,
forbade the filing of a statute in the aerarian archives excepting
in the presence of witnesses.<a id="FNanchor_2765" href="#Footnote_2765" class="fnanchor">[2765]</a> In this year M. Porcius Cato
and L. Marcius, tribunes of the plebs, carried a law which
threatened with punishment commanders who reported falsely
to the senate the number of the enemy killed and of citizens
lost, and required them within ten days after returning to the
city to give their oath before the urban quaestors that they had
transmitted correct reports.<a id="FNanchor_2766" href="#Footnote_2766" class="fnanchor">[2766]</a> For the year 60 must be mentioned
the pretorian law of Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos, which
abolished vectigalia in Italy,<a id="FNanchor_2767" href="#Footnote_2767" class="fnanchor">[2767]</a> and the tribunician rogation of L.
Flavius for granting lands to Pompey’s veterans. The latter
failed through the disapproval of the senate.<a id="FNanchor_2768" href="#Footnote_2768" class="fnanchor">[2768]</a> Far more interesting
because of the procedure, though otherwise of little consequence,
was the tribunician rogation of Herennius of the same
year for transferring P. Clodius to the plebeian rank. The
subject has been considered in an earlier chapter.<a id="FNanchor_2769" href="#Footnote_2769" class="fnanchor">[2769]</a></p>

<p>The year of Caesar’s consulship was one of unusual legislative
activity. Resuming the agrarian policy of the Gracchi,
which had been undone by the statute of 111,<a id="FNanchor_2770" href="#Footnote_2770" class="fnanchor">[2770]</a> he promulgated
early in the year a bill for the distribution of lands, which exempted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
the Campanian<a id="FNanchor_2771" href="#Footnote_2771" class="fnanchor">[2771]</a> and Stellatine<a id="FNanchor_2772" href="#Footnote_2772" class="fnanchor">[2772]</a> territory as well as that
of Volaterrae, which Sulla had confiscated without ejecting the
inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_2773" href="#Footnote_2773" class="fnanchor">[2773]</a> As little other public land remained in Italy, the
bill ordered that money accruing from the sale of booty taken
by Pompey, and from the new revenues of the territory he had
won for Rome, be used for the purchase of lands from those
who were willing to sell at the values assessed in the last census.<a id="FNanchor_2774" href="#Footnote_2774" class="fnanchor">[2774]</a>
The beneficiaries were the needy citizens and the veterans
of Pompey.<a id="FNanchor_2775" href="#Footnote_2775" class="fnanchor">[2775]</a> The lots assigned were to remain inalienable
twenty years.<a id="FNanchor_2776" href="#Footnote_2776" class="fnanchor">[2776]</a> The work of distribution was to be in the hands
of a board of twenty—vigintiviri<a id="FNanchor_2777" href="#Footnote_2777" class="fnanchor">[2777]</a>—which should not include
the author of the law.<a id="FNanchor_2778" href="#Footnote_2778" class="fnanchor">[2778]</a> A sub-committee of this large board
must have been the Vviri agris dandis adsignandis iudicandis,<a id="FNanchor_2779" href="#Footnote_2779" class="fnanchor">[2779]</a>
who in the opinion of Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_2780" href="#Footnote_2780" class="fnanchor">[2780]</a> possessed the sole judicial
power connected with the work of distribution. As the senate
studiously delayed action on the measure, though unable to
offer any criticism,<a id="FNanchor_2781" href="#Footnote_2781" class="fnanchor">[2781]</a> Caesar without its sanction presented the
bill to the people.<a id="FNanchor_2782" href="#Footnote_2782" class="fnanchor">[2782]</a> Bibulus, his colleague, backed by three
tribunes of the plebs, not only protested against the bill,<a id="FNanchor_2783" href="#Footnote_2783" class="fnanchor">[2783]</a> but
resorted to sky-watching and the proclamation of festivals to
prevent its adoption.<a id="FNanchor_2784" href="#Footnote_2784" class="fnanchor">[2784]</a> Disregarding this opposition, Caesar
with the support of Pompey and Crassus offered his rogation to
the tribes,<a id="FNanchor_2785" href="#Footnote_2785" class="fnanchor">[2785]</a> who accepted it with great enthusiasm. For the
remainder of his term he ignored the senate in all his legislation.
As to his other agrarian provisions, it is difficult to determine
whether they were attached to this rogation before its enactment
or formed a new bill. In favor of the second alternative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
it is to be noticed in the first place that Cicero and others
mention Julian agrarian laws,<a id="FNanchor_2786" href="#Footnote_2786" class="fnanchor">[2786]</a> and that Cicero’s expression
“Campanian lex”<a id="FNanchor_2787" href="#Footnote_2787" class="fnanchor">[2787]</a> could describe a measure relating to the
Campanian territory but not the whole group of agrarian provisions
of that year. Moreover although Cicero was acquainted
with the Julian rogation from the beginning of the year,<a id="FNanchor_2788" href="#Footnote_2788" class="fnanchor">[2788]</a> he did
not at Formiae hear of the inclusion of the Campanian territory
till near the end of April.<a id="FNanchor_2789" href="#Footnote_2789" class="fnanchor">[2789]</a> It might be assumed that after the
senate and Bibulus showed opposition Caesar modified the original
rogation before putting it to vote, but no mention is made
of an alteration. Finally Dio Cassius<a id="FNanchor_2790" href="#Footnote_2790" class="fnanchor">[2790]</a> and Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_2791" href="#Footnote_2791" class="fnanchor">[2791]</a> speak
distinctly of an earlier and a later law.<a id="FNanchor_2792" href="#Footnote_2792" class="fnanchor">[2792]</a> On the whole it seems
probable therefore that toward the end of April Caesar promulgated
a second agrarian bill which provided for the distribution
of the Campanian and Stellatine lands among needy citizens,
preferably those who had three or more children.<a id="FNanchor_2793" href="#Footnote_2793" class="fnanchor">[2793]</a> The complete
execution of the law would dispose of all public lands in
Italy from which a revenue might be derived. An article required
not only senators within a specified time to swear that
they would support the measures<a id="FNanchor_2794" href="#Footnote_2794" class="fnanchor">[2794]</a> but also candidates for office<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
for the following year to give their oath in contio that they
would not propose any modification or repeal of them.<a id="FNanchor_2795" href="#Footnote_2795" class="fnanchor">[2795]</a></p>

<p>This statute was full of significance both in content and in
the manner of enactment: it set at defiance the senate and the
auspices; it deprived the state of important revenues, increasing
correspondingly the financial burden on the provinces; it
brought relief to many proletarians, while encouraging militarism
through a provision for Pompey’s veterans. Ostensibly
democratic, it cemented and announced to the world the triumvirate
of Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey—a combination of
democratic, plutocratic, and military bossism, which proved
more dangerous to political liberty than had been the dictatorship
of Sulla. The last great agrarian law of the republic contained
in itself a prophecy of the monarchy which its author
was soon to establish.</p>

<p>Because of the losses suffered in Asia in the recent war with
Mithridates, Caesar carried a law, also early in the year, for a
remission of a third of the sum due to the treasury from the
publicans of that province. As the senate had failed to pass a
measure of relief for the contractors of revenue,<a id="FNanchor_2796" href="#Footnote_2796" class="fnanchor">[2796]</a> the concession
from Caesar and the people served to alienate the feelings of
the knights from the optimates and to attach them to the ambitious
consul.<a id="FNanchor_2797" href="#Footnote_2797" class="fnanchor">[2797]</a> Next to the agrarian statute, however, the lex de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
pecuniis repetundis was the most important piece of legislation
of his consulship. Comprising at least a hundred and one
articles,<a id="FNanchor_2798" href="#Footnote_2798" class="fnanchor">[2798]</a> including much material from earlier laws on extortion,
it dealt minutely with all the particulars of the offence,
procedure, and punishment so exhaustively as to render further
comitial legislation on the subject unnecessary.<a id="FNanchor_2799" href="#Footnote_2799" class="fnanchor">[2799]</a> It aimed to
protect alike citizens, provincials, and allies from every form
of misrule and oppression by the home and promagisterial
authorities. It regulated strictly the supplies due from the
provincials to the promagistrate and his officium, including
shelter and sustenance for man and beast.<a id="FNanchor_2800" href="#Footnote_2800" class="fnanchor">[2800]</a> Under this law
the governor was forbidden without an order from Rome to
conduct diplomatic business with foreign states, to wage war,
or to cross the boundary of his province,<a id="FNanchor_2801" href="#Footnote_2801" class="fnanchor">[2801]</a> or to demand of the
cities crown gold for a triumph not decreed by the senate.<a id="FNanchor_2802" href="#Footnote_2802" class="fnanchor">[2802]</a> On
retiring from his command he was to leave copies of his administrative
accounts in two cities of his province and an exact
duplicate in the aerarium.<a id="FNanchor_2803" href="#Footnote_2803" class="fnanchor">[2803]</a> It provided further for the punishment
of corrupt accusers, jurors, and witnesses in cases under
the law.<a id="FNanchor_2804" href="#Footnote_2804" class="fnanchor">[2804]</a> A man convicted of the crime was fined and compelled
to restore extorted property; and in case his estate did
not suffice to cover the loss, an investigation could be made as
to who had shared his gains.<a id="FNanchor_2805" href="#Footnote_2805" class="fnanchor">[2805]</a> He was also to be expelled from
the senate and banished.<a id="FNanchor_2806" href="#Footnote_2806" class="fnanchor">[2806]</a> The severity of the law is commended
by Cicero.<a id="FNanchor_2807" href="#Footnote_2807" class="fnanchor">[2807]</a> Caesar’s legislation concerning extortion
was reënforced (i) by the judiciary law of P. Vatinius, tribune
of the plebs, of the same year, which granted to both accuser
and accused greater freedom in the rejection of jurors than had
been allowed by the corresponding law of Sulla, the terms of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
which however are not definitely known;<a id="FNanchor_2808" href="#Footnote_2808" class="fnanchor">[2808]</a> (2) by a statute of
Q. Fufius Calenus, praetor in 59, which required the three
decuries to deposit their votes in three separate urns, the object
being to establish class responsibility.<a id="FNanchor_2809" href="#Footnote_2809" class="fnanchor">[2809]</a> The remaining comitial
acts of Caesar were merely administrative. As a favor to
Pompey, who in his eastern campaign had received support
from Ptolemy Auletes, king of Egypt,<a id="FNanchor_2810" href="#Footnote_2810" class="fnanchor">[2810]</a> Caesar in the beginning
of his consulship<a id="FNanchor_2811" href="#Footnote_2811" class="fnanchor">[2811]</a> carried a resolution for acknowledging the
latter as an ally and friend of the Roman people.<a id="FNanchor_2812" href="#Footnote_2812" class="fnanchor">[2812]</a> Later in
the year, to repay Pompey for his support of the agrarian
statute, Caesar secured against the will of the senate the enactment
of a law for confirming his ally’s arrangements in the
East.<a id="FNanchor_2813" href="#Footnote_2813" class="fnanchor">[2813]</a> Lastly may be mentioned the lex curiata for the arrogation
of P. Clodius Pulcher proposed by Caesar in the capacity
of pontifex maximus, a measure considered in an earlier chapter.<a id="FNanchor_2814" href="#Footnote_2814" class="fnanchor">[2814]</a>
Clodius wished to qualify himself for the tribunate of the
plebs, and his design was aided by Caesar in the expectation
that he would occupy the attention of Cicero, the only strong
opponent of the triumviri. Caesar’s immediate future was provided
for by a plebiscite of his friend Vatinius, which granted
him Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum as a province for five years
beginning March 1, 59.<a id="FNanchor_2815" href="#Footnote_2815" class="fnanchor">[2815]</a> He was to have three legions<a id="FNanchor_2816" href="#Footnote_2816" class="fnanchor">[2816]</a> and to
name his own legati, who were to enjoy propretorian rank.<a id="FNanchor_2817" href="#Footnote_2817" class="fnanchor">[2817]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>
The senate, which had looked unwillingly upon these proceedings,
now added Comata and a fourth legion, partly because of
the conviction that in the face of an imminent war with the
Helvetians no one would be willing to take that province without
Cisalpina as a support, and partly through fear lest the
popular party might gain the additional credit of bestowing it.<a id="FNanchor_2818" href="#Footnote_2818" class="fnanchor">[2818]</a>
In one respect the position was far better than that held by
Pompey in the East: while winning prestige in a popular conquest<a id="FNanchor_2819" href="#Footnote_2819" class="fnanchor">[2819]</a>
and attaching to himself a powerful army, Caesar would
be near enough to Rome to control the political situation.<a id="FNanchor_2820" href="#Footnote_2820" class="fnanchor">[2820]</a> Intellectual
brilliancy would serve in place of experience. In fact,
in addition to maintaining the position of democratic boss of
Rome, the outlook seemed to him favorable for wresting from
his fellow-triumvir the sceptre of the military monarch.<a id="FNanchor_2821" href="#Footnote_2821" class="fnanchor">[2821]</a></p>

<p>P. Clodius Pulcher, tribune of the plebs in 58, seems to
have worked partly as an agent of Caesar for the more complete
organization of democracy, and partly from motives of
personal hatred for Cicero. He first proposed a frumentarian
plebiscite, which provided for the absolutely free distribution
of grain monthly among the citizens resident in Rome.<a id="FNanchor_2822" href="#Footnote_2822" class="fnanchor">[2822]</a> In
vain the optimates complained that the abolition of the existing
price, which was that prescribed by the Sempronian law,<a id="FNanchor_2823" href="#Footnote_2823" class="fnanchor">[2823]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
would rob the treasury of nearly a fifth of its income.<a id="FNanchor_2824" href="#Footnote_2824" class="fnanchor">[2824]</a> Accepted
by the tribes, the law proved a most effective means of
maintaining a numerous mob of proletarians ever present and
willing to vote for the measures of their political patrons, the
leaders of the democracy. A closely related plebiscite permitted
the free organization of clubs (collegia),<a id="FNanchor_2825" href="#Footnote_2825" class="fnanchor">[2825]</a> which a senatus
consultum of 64 had strictly limited,<a id="FNanchor_2826" href="#Footnote_2826" class="fnanchor">[2826]</a> but which now
became an active part of the democratic organization.<a id="FNanchor_2827" href="#Footnote_2827" class="fnanchor">[2827]</a> His
legislation, however, was not utterly devoid of statesmanship.
A third act, by repealing those articles of the Aelian and
Fufian statutes which applied obnuntiations to law-making
assemblies, deprived the nobility of their most effective means
of controlling legislation.<a id="FNanchor_2828" href="#Footnote_2828" class="fnanchor">[2828]</a> An article of the same statute declared
all dies fasti available for legislation.<a id="FNanchor_2829" href="#Footnote_2829" class="fnanchor">[2829]</a> This measure
went far toward abolishing a usage which had made religion a
mockery and public life a farce. To limit the arbitrary power
of the censors, Clodius enacted through a plebiscite that these
magistrates should place their stigma upon those only whom
they had jointly condemned after having heard sufficient testimony.<a id="FNanchor_2830" href="#Footnote_2830" class="fnanchor">[2830]</a>
Another comitial act prohibited the secretaries of the
quaestors from engaging in business in the provinces.<a id="FNanchor_2831" href="#Footnote_2831" class="fnanchor">[2831]</a> The
last three statutes mentioned were useful reforms. His most
famous measure was the law which prescribed the penalty of
interdict from fire and water for any one who had put to death
a Roman citizen without trial.<a id="FNanchor_2832" href="#Footnote_2832" class="fnanchor">[2832]</a> Strengthening the Sempronian
law of appeal,<a id="FNanchor_2833" href="#Footnote_2833" class="fnanchor">[2833]</a> it forced the party issue as to the question
whether that act could apply to persons accused of having
attempted to overthrow the state. The optimates contended
that such persons were no longer citizens but enemies
and hence outside the pale of law<a id="FNanchor_2834" href="#Footnote_2834" class="fnanchor">[2834]</a>—a principle which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span>
populares held to be destructive of liberty. From a democratic
point of view the Clodian law was just and necessary;
but unfortunately Cicero, who in putting to death the associates
of Catiline had simply acted for the senate, was to be
made the scapegoat. Fearing condemnation under the law,
Cicero voluntarily retired into exile, whereupon a new plebiscite
declared the interdict to be legally in operation.<a id="FNanchor_2835" href="#Footnote_2835" class="fnanchor">[2835]</a> In the
following year he was recalled with great enthusiasm by a
resolution of the comitia centuriata proposed by the consuls
P. Cornelius Lentulus and Q. Caecilius Metellus.<a id="FNanchor_2836" href="#Footnote_2836" class="fnanchor">[2836]</a> The same
magistrates were authors of a law for conferring upon Pompey
the care of the grain supply, which he was to administer five
years with unlimited proconsular imperium.<a id="FNanchor_2837" href="#Footnote_2837" class="fnanchor">[2837]</a> In spite of such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
efforts to prop up his power in order to counterpoise that of
Caesar, the latter through the prestige of his brilliant victories
in Gaul and the liberal use of money in the capital far outshone
his fellow-triumviri. The only hope for their ambition
was to be found in the good will and favor of the great proconsul.
As the result of the conference held by the triumviri
at Luca, 56, Pompey and Crassus were elected to a second
consulship for 55 through the votes of Caesar’s soldiers, who
were given a furlough to attend the comitia held purposely late
in the year.<a id="FNanchor_2838" href="#Footnote_2838" class="fnanchor">[2838]</a> As proconsuls Pompey and Crassus were to be
given advantageous commands, and Caesar was to receive as
his reward a prolongation of his governorship.<a id="FNanchor_2839" href="#Footnote_2839" class="fnanchor">[2839]</a> Subservient
tribunes were found to propose the desired measures, and it had
long been an easy matter to obtain a majority in favor of any
conceivable bill. C. Trebonius drew up a law for granting
Syria to Crassus and the two Spains to Pompey for a period
of five years, with a dispensation for both from that article of
the lex Iulia repetundarum which forbade promagistrates of
their own free will to declare war.<a id="FNanchor_2840" href="#Footnote_2840" class="fnanchor">[2840]</a> The intercessions of tribunes
and all other opposition were violently overborne, and the
rogation was readily accepted by the people.<a id="FNanchor_2841" href="#Footnote_2841" class="fnanchor">[2841]</a> Thereupon the
two consuls secured the passage of an act for extending Caesar’s
command.<a id="FNanchor_2842" href="#Footnote_2842" class="fnanchor">[2842]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that these consuls had been elected
with the help of the clubs organized under the Clodian law of
58, they must have felt such associations to be a menace to
themselves as well as to the public peace. Crassus accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span>
carried through the assembly a lex de sodaliciis, which increased
the penalty for ambitus committed through the agency of clubs.<a id="FNanchor_2843" href="#Footnote_2843" class="fnanchor">[2843]</a>
It also ordered that the jury in such cases be made up by the
accuser from any four tribes he should choose, however unfavorable
they might be to the accused,<a id="FNanchor_2844" href="#Footnote_2844" class="fnanchor">[2844]</a> who had merely the right
to reject one of the four tribal decuries thus presented,<a id="FNanchor_2845" href="#Footnote_2845" class="fnanchor">[2845]</a> in so
far as the court itself did not grant him the further privilege of
rejecting individuals.<a id="FNanchor_2846" href="#Footnote_2846" class="fnanchor">[2846]</a> It is difficult to understand how impartial
justice could be administered under such a law. But no
further legislation concerning ambitus was attempted till 52,
when Pompey in his third consulship carried a statute which
increased the penalty for the offence and made the procedure
more strict.<a id="FNanchor_2847" href="#Footnote_2847" class="fnanchor">[2847]</a> The attention of Pompey in his second consulship
was directed rather to other classes of crimes. First he
had a statute adopted concerning parricide (the murder of a
near relative or patron), which hitherto had been provided for
by the Cornelian lex de sicariis et veneficis.<a id="FNanchor_2848" href="#Footnote_2848" class="fnanchor">[2848]</a> His project for
displacing the lex Iulia repetundarum by a statute which should
make the non-senatorial class specifically responsible failed to
become a law.<a id="FNanchor_2849" href="#Footnote_2849" class="fnanchor">[2849]</a> A sumptuary rogation for restricting personal
expenditure he voluntarily withdrew on the advice of Hortensius,
who persuaded him that luxury and delicacy of life were
but the fitting adornments of empire.<a id="FNanchor_2850" href="#Footnote_2850" class="fnanchor">[2850]</a> His lex iudiciaria ordered
the urban praetor to begin the selection of jurors from
the wealthiest of each of the three classes, and thence to descend
gradually to the poorer members, the object being to
make the composition of the courts as aristocratic as the terms
of the Aurelian statute of 70 would allow.<a id="FNanchor_2851" href="#Footnote_2851" class="fnanchor">[2851]</a> The lex de vi of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span>
his third consulship, 52, was merely for the appointment of a
special commission to try those who were accused of having
murdered Clodius, burned the Curia, and besieged the house of
the interrex M. Aemilius Lepidus. It determined the composition
of the court and the penalty to be inflicted.<a id="FNanchor_2852" href="#Footnote_2852" class="fnanchor">[2852]</a> Of his statute
de iure magistratuum, passed in the latter year, that article
only is known which reiterated the law of 63 for prohibiting
candidacies in absentia. But as a plebiscite had been passed
earlier in the year to dispense Caesar from the law of 63,<a id="FNanchor_2853" href="#Footnote_2853" class="fnanchor">[2853]</a> and
as Pompey did not dare antagonize him by abolishing the plebiscite
here mentioned, he secured the adoption of an additional
law for excepting such candidates as had been or should be dispensed
by comitial action.<a id="FNanchor_2854" href="#Footnote_2854" class="fnanchor">[2854]</a> But Caesar’s prospect of passing
immediately from his Gallic command to a second consulship
was more effectually blocked by Pompey’s lex de provinciis,
which, embodying a senatus consultum of the previous year,<a id="FNanchor_2855" href="#Footnote_2855" class="fnanchor">[2855]</a>
ordered that five years should intervene between the expiration
of a magistracy and the beginning of the corresponding promagistracy.<a id="FNanchor_2856" href="#Footnote_2856" class="fnanchor">[2856]</a>
The general purpose was to dampen the ardor of
the ambitious, who sought praetorships and consulships merely
as a stepping-stone to lucrative and influential commands in the
provinces. Its immediate effect, however, was to precipitate
the conflict between Caesar and Pompey which brought the
republic to ruin. The relation of the law to this event requires
explanation. In the Pompeian-Licinian act of 55 for prolonging
Caesar’s command measures were taken that the senate
should not discuss the question of succession to him before
March 1, 50. According to the Sempronian law,<a id="FNanchor_2857" href="#Footnote_2857" class="fnanchor">[2857]</a> therefore,
the senate could assign his provinces to no consuls earlier than
those of 49; hence Caesar would continue in command during
that year while suing for the consulship for 48. But by the
Pompeian law of 52 the Sempronian was abolished, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span>
senate was given an opportunity to appoint a successor to him
on or after March 1, 50.<a id="FNanchor_2858" href="#Footnote_2858" class="fnanchor">[2858]</a></p>

<p>From the close of the second consulship of Pompey to the
beginning of Caesar’s dictatorship there was no important legislation.<a id="FNanchor_2859" href="#Footnote_2859" class="fnanchor">[2859]</a></p>

<h4>III. <i>The Decline of the Republican Comitia</i><br />
<span class="smcap">From 49 to about 30</span></h4>

<p>With the dictatorship of Caesar begins the last stage in the
life of the republican comitia. For them it was from the beginning
of his supremacy essentially a time of decline. Although
Caesar continued to submit his plans to the assemblies for legalization,
he rapidly concentrated in his own person powers and
functions hitherto exercised by the people; and the triumviri,
his successors, after a sham-republican interregnum, constituted
in law as well as in fact a three-headed despot. Mention will
first be made of the comitial acts which conferred powers and
honors on Caesar during his life. In 49 when news of his success
in Spain reached Rome, M. Aemilius Lepidus, a partisan
who was then urban praetor, persuaded the tribes to adopt a
resolution empowering the author to name Caesar dictator.<a id="FNanchor_2860" href="#Footnote_2860" class="fnanchor">[2860]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451"></a>[451]</span>
Entering upon this office after his return to Rome, about the
end of November, Caesar used it to secure the ratification of
laws—to be considered hereafter—and to hold the electoral
comitia. After eleven days he resigned. At this election he
was chosen consul with P. Servilius Vatia as colleague.<a id="FNanchor_2861" href="#Footnote_2861" class="fnanchor">[2861]</a> About
the middle of October, 48, when the senate and people heard of
the death of Pompey, they conferred on him by law (1) absolute
judicial authority over the partisans of Pompey,<a id="FNanchor_2862" href="#Footnote_2862" class="fnanchor">[2862]</a> (2) the right
to make peace and war at his own pleasure, the pretext being
the development of opposition to him in Africa, (3) the right to
be candidate for the consulship five years in succession,<a id="FNanchor_2863" href="#Footnote_2863" class="fnanchor">[2863]</a> (4) the
dictatorship for an indefinite period, to which he was appointed
by his colleague in the consulship,<a id="FNanchor_2864" href="#Footnote_2864" class="fnanchor">[2864]</a> (5) the tribunician authority
for life, with the privilege of sitting with the tribunes, (6) the
right to preside at the election of all patrician magistrates, for
which reason the comitia were postponed till his return to the
city, (7) the right to assign the pretorian provinces according to
his own judgment, (8) the right to triumph over Juba, king of
Mauretania, though at that time he did not know there was to
be a war with that state.<a id="FNanchor_2865" href="#Footnote_2865" class="fnanchor">[2865]</a> Near the end of April, 46, when
news came of the victory at Thapsus, the Romans granted him
(1) the censoria potestas with the title of praefectus morum for
three years, (2) the annual dictatorship for ten years, (3) the
right to nominate candidates for both ordinary and extraordinary
offices. These powers were doubtless conferred by comitial
action. At the same time great honors were heaped upon him,
probably through senatus consulta.<a id="FNanchor_2866" href="#Footnote_2866" class="fnanchor">[2866]</a> Again in April, 45, after
the battle of Munda honors were showered on him in still
greater profusion.<a id="FNanchor_2867" href="#Footnote_2867" class="fnanchor">[2867]</a> Politically the most important were the
lifelong, hereditary title of imperator, which he bore as a second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
cognomen,<a id="FNanchor_2868" href="#Footnote_2868" class="fnanchor">[2868]</a> the sole right to command soldiers and to manage
the public funds, the privilege of being consul ten years in succession
(which he did not use), the prefecture of morals and the
dictatorship for life, and finally deification under the title of the
“Invincible God.”<a id="FNanchor_2869" href="#Footnote_2869" class="fnanchor">[2869]</a> In fact for the remainder of his life there
was no cessation in the bestowal of divine and human honors.
Among those of his last year were the tribunician sanctity<a id="FNanchor_2870" href="#Footnote_2870" class="fnanchor">[2870]</a> and
the right to have as many wives as he pleased—the latter
granted by a plebiscite of C. Helvius Cinna.<a id="FNanchor_2871" href="#Footnote_2871" class="fnanchor">[2871]</a> The theocratic
monarchy which the Romans were erecting for him on the ruins
of the republic left no independence to the senate or the assemblies.
The functions of the latter were especially abridged by
the large power of nominating and appointing officials possessed
by the monarch.<a id="FNanchor_2872" href="#Footnote_2872" class="fnanchor">[2872]</a> His important legislative plans, however, he
brought before the people, preferably in their tribal comitia.</p>

<p>In December, 49, after returning from Spain, Caesar sought
to relieve somewhat the distress of debtors and at the same time
to quiet the general fear that he might decree a cancellation of
all debts.<a id="FNanchor_2873" href="#Footnote_2873" class="fnanchor">[2873]</a> This object he accomplished through a law, (1) that
interest already paid should be deducted from the principal,
(2) that the property of the debtor should be taken in payment
of the balance—not at the low values then existing, but on the
basis of ante-bellum prices, (3) that no one should hoard more
than fifteen thousand denarii in cash.<a id="FNanchor_2874" href="#Footnote_2874" class="fnanchor">[2874]</a> The third article was a
renewal of an old law.<a id="FNanchor_2875" href="#Footnote_2875" class="fnanchor">[2875]</a> Another statute,<a id="FNanchor_2876" href="#Footnote_2876" class="fnanchor">[2876]</a> 47, released from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span>
year’s rent tenants of houses in Rome which brought the owner
more than 2000 sesterces or of houses outside the city which
earned more than 500.<a id="FNanchor_2877" href="#Footnote_2877" class="fnanchor">[2877]</a> These houses were private property,
and the law was therefore a partial abolition of private debts.<a id="FNanchor_2878" href="#Footnote_2878" class="fnanchor">[2878]</a>
Such prosperity came that in another year, 46, Caesar found it
possible to cut down the number who received free grain from
320,000 to 150,000.<a id="FNanchor_2879" href="#Footnote_2879" class="fnanchor">[2879]</a> He provided for the surplus population
as well as for his veterans by colonies in Gaul, Spain, Africa,
Macedonia, Greece, and Asia.<a id="FNanchor_2880" href="#Footnote_2880" class="fnanchor">[2880]</a> Eighty thousand citizens found
homes in these provincial settlements.<a id="FNanchor_2881" href="#Footnote_2881" class="fnanchor">[2881]</a></p>

<p>Among Caesar’s most admirable traits was his liberality in
restoring to their civil rights those who were under disfranchisement
and in granting the citizenship to aliens. At his suggestion
M. Antonius, tribune of the plebs in 49, secured the enactment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span>
of a plebiscite for restoring the ius honorum to the children of
those whom Sulla had proscribed.<a id="FNanchor_2882" href="#Footnote_2882" class="fnanchor">[2882]</a> Near the end of the same
year, also at his request, the praetors and tribunes brought
before the people and carried proposals for the recall of certain
persons who had been exiled, unjustly as he believed, under the
Pompeian law on ambitus.<a id="FNanchor_2883" href="#Footnote_2883" class="fnanchor">[2883]</a> It was further at his suggestion
that L. Roscius, probably praetor, enacted a comitial law for
granting the citizenship to the Transpadani who at this time
possessed simply the ius Latii.<a id="FNanchor_2884" href="#Footnote_2884" class="fnanchor">[2884]</a> Another law of unknown
authorship confirmed the grant of the franchise already made
on his own responsibility to the people of Gades.<a id="FNanchor_2885" href="#Footnote_2885" class="fnanchor">[2885]</a></p>

<p>Among his administrative improvements was the increase in
the number of praetors from eight to ten<a id="FNanchor_2886" href="#Footnote_2886" class="fnanchor">[2886]</a> in 47, for which a
comitial statute may be assumed.<a id="FNanchor_2887" href="#Footnote_2887" class="fnanchor">[2887]</a> The people surrendered to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span>
him a large part of their electoral right through the plebiscite
of L. Antonius,<a id="FNanchor_2888" href="#Footnote_2888" class="fnanchor">[2888]</a> December, 45, which granted him the privilege
of nominating and presenting to the comitia a half of the candidates
below the consulship.<a id="FNanchor_2889" href="#Footnote_2889" class="fnanchor">[2889]</a> The degradation into which the
ordinary magistracies had been brought by the supremacy of
Caesar is indicated by the deposition of two tribunes of the
plebs, C. Epidius Marullus and L. Caesetius Flavus, because of
their opposition to monarchy, 44, through a plebiscite of their
colleague, C. Helvius Cinna.<a id="FNanchor_2890" href="#Footnote_2890" class="fnanchor">[2890]</a></p>

<p>To the year 46 belongs Caesar’s legislation on judicial matters.
First disqualifying the tribuni aerarii for jury service,<a id="FNanchor_2891" href="#Footnote_2891" class="fnanchor">[2891]</a> he ordered
through the comitia that the courts be composed exclusively of
the senators and knights.<a id="FNanchor_2892" href="#Footnote_2892" class="fnanchor">[2892]</a> The man who had been carried to
supreme power on the shoulders of the common people now
spurned even the most respectable of their number from association
with himself in the administration.<a id="FNanchor_2893" href="#Footnote_2893" class="fnanchor">[2893]</a> It is known that he
enacted laws on individual crimes.<a id="FNanchor_2894" href="#Footnote_2894" class="fnanchor">[2894]</a> A lex de vi and a lex de
maiestate are mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_2895" href="#Footnote_2895" class="fnanchor">[2895]</a> but it is not known in what they
differed from those of earlier or later date.<a id="FNanchor_2896" href="#Footnote_2896" class="fnanchor">[2896]</a> His sumptuary
statute of the same year<a id="FNanchor_2897" href="#Footnote_2897" class="fnanchor">[2897]</a> restricted the expense of the table,<a id="FNanchor_2898" href="#Footnote_2898" class="fnanchor">[2898]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span>
sepulchral monuments, dwellings,<a id="FNanchor_2899" href="#Footnote_2899" class="fnanchor">[2899]</a> furniture, clothing, jewels,
and other luxuries, covering the ground in great detail.<a id="FNanchor_2900" href="#Footnote_2900" class="fnanchor">[2900]</a> A
Cassian plebiscite empowered him to recruit the patrician
rank<a id="FNanchor_2901" href="#Footnote_2901" class="fnanchor">[2901]</a>—a means of creating a nobility devoted to himself, while
supplying a religious need. A law proposed by himself (de
provinciis) limited proconsuls to two years of command and
propraetors to one,<a id="FNanchor_2902" href="#Footnote_2902" class="fnanchor">[2902]</a> that in future they might not acquire such
strength as to overthrow the civil authority, after the pattern
set by the author of the regulation. It was by a vote of the
people, too, that the famous lex Iulia municipalis was adopted,
probably in the autumn of 46.<a id="FNanchor_2903" href="#Footnote_2903" class="fnanchor">[2903]</a> Although there has been much
controversy regarding the nature of the document,<a id="FNanchor_2904" href="#Footnote_2904" class="fnanchor">[2904]</a> it is most
probably a general municipal statute. Far from exhaustive, it
had to be supplemented by special laws for the several cities.<a id="FNanchor_2905" href="#Footnote_2905" class="fnanchor">[2905]</a>
The extant fragment, which seems to begin with the second
table, regulates (1) applications of citizens resident at Rome for
free grain,<a id="FNanchor_2906" href="#Footnote_2906" class="fnanchor">[2906]</a> (2) the aedilician supervision of the streets, buildings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span>
and games of the capital,<a id="FNanchor_2907" href="#Footnote_2907" class="fnanchor">[2907]</a> (3) the qualifications for the
magistracies and the decurionate in the municipia,<a id="FNanchor_2908" href="#Footnote_2908" class="fnanchor">[2908]</a> (4) the
introduction of the Roman census in the municipia,<a id="FNanchor_2909" href="#Footnote_2909" class="fnanchor">[2909]</a> and (5) of
individual Roman statutes in those municipia which enjoyed the
laws of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_2910" href="#Footnote_2910" class="fnanchor">[2910]</a> The inclusion of the capital with the cities of
Roman rights throughout the empire in one general law marks
the first step in the monarchical process of reducing Rome to
the level of the municipia.<a id="FNanchor_2911" href="#Footnote_2911" class="fnanchor">[2911]</a></p>

<p>In comparison with the amount of reform work undertaken
by Caesar the legislative activity of the people was remarkably
slight. The growth of the monarchy wrought the decline of
the comitia as well as of the senate; and the assassination
of the monarch brought equally to the republic and to the
assemblies but a short interval of pretended liberty.<a id="FNanchor_2912" href="#Footnote_2912" class="fnanchor">[2912]</a> A lex
proposed by the consul M. Antonius confirmed the acts of
Caesar and established as law the plans which he left in
writing at his death.<a id="FNanchor_2913" href="#Footnote_2913" class="fnanchor">[2913]</a> It was arbitrarily used by the consul<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span>
for legalizing every whim of his own. His colonial law,
passed shortly after Caesar’s assassination,<a id="FNanchor_2914" href="#Footnote_2914" class="fnanchor">[2914]</a> seems to have
been used by him for establishing in Italy a permanent support
for himself.<a id="FNanchor_2915" href="#Footnote_2915" class="fnanchor">[2915]</a> The last known agrarian law of the republic
is that of his brother, L. Antonius, tribune of the plebs in
the same year, 44. It ordered the distribution of the Pomptine
marshes—which the author asserted were then ready for cultivation<a id="FNanchor_2916" href="#Footnote_2916" class="fnanchor">[2916]</a>—and
other extensive tracts.<a id="FNanchor_2917" href="#Footnote_2917" class="fnanchor">[2917]</a> The execution of the
measure was in the hands of septemviri,<a id="FNanchor_2918" href="#Footnote_2918" class="fnanchor">[2918]</a> including the author<a id="FNanchor_2919" href="#Footnote_2919" class="fnanchor">[2919]</a>
and his two brothers.<a id="FNanchor_2920" href="#Footnote_2920" class="fnanchor">[2920]</a> It was annulled in the following year
by the senate on the ground that it had been violently passed.<a id="FNanchor_2921" href="#Footnote_2921" class="fnanchor">[2921]</a></p>

<p>Meantime the consul Antonius continued his legislation. An
arbitrary act restored to the pontifical college its ancient right
to appoint its chief in place of the long-used election by seventeen
tribes.<a id="FNanchor_2922" href="#Footnote_2922" class="fnanchor">[2922]</a> Next to colonization, however, his chief legislative
interest was in the reform of the courts. He repealed
the Julian statute concerning the qualifications of jurors;<a id="FNanchor_2923" href="#Footnote_2923" class="fnanchor">[2923]</a> and
instead of restoring the eligibility of the tribuni aerarii, he
made up a third decury of retired centurions and other veterans.<a id="FNanchor_2924" href="#Footnote_2924" class="fnanchor">[2924]</a>
His law for granting an appeal to the people from the quaestiones
de vi and de maiestate,<a id="FNanchor_2925" href="#Footnote_2925" class="fnanchor">[2925]</a> had it remained in force,
would as Cicero asserts have abolished these courts and have
given free rein to mob violence, such as comitial trials for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span>
these crimes must necessarily be under conditions as they
then existed.<a id="FNanchor_2926" href="#Footnote_2926" class="fnanchor">[2926]</a> Popularity was the aim of this measure as
well as of his lex which forever abolished the dictatorship.
Along with all his other laws they were annulled by the
senate in February 43.<a id="FNanchor_2927" href="#Footnote_2927" class="fnanchor">[2927]</a></p>

<p>The establishment of the triumviri rei publicae constituendae
in 43 practically abolished the functions of the comitia, as
these three potentates usurped the right of filling all offices by
appointment and of managing affairs according to their pleasure
without consulting either the senate or the people.<a id="FNanchor_2928" href="#Footnote_2928" class="fnanchor">[2928]</a> The power
they had seized was legalized for a period of five years by
the plebiscite of P. Titius, November 43, passed without regard
to the trinundinum.<a id="FNanchor_2929" href="#Footnote_2929" class="fnanchor">[2929]</a> The reference of business to the people
was thereafter a rare indulgence. It may have been through
a comitial act that the triumviri resolved upon building a
temple to Serapis and Isis in the first year of their rule.<a id="FNanchor_2930" href="#Footnote_2930" class="fnanchor">[2930]</a> We
are less certain that the measure of Octavianus in 41 for a
partial remission of rents was offered to the people.<a id="FNanchor_2931" href="#Footnote_2931" class="fnanchor">[2931]</a> To the
year 40 belongs the lex Falcidia, of P. Falcidius, tribune
of the plebs, which permitted a man to bequeath no more
than three-fourths of his estate, leaving one-fourth to his
natural heirs.<a id="FNanchor_2932" href="#Footnote_2932" class="fnanchor">[2932]</a> We need not be surprised to find that the
rulers gladly allowed the people to vote them honors. In
their first year they were awarded civic crowns by a comitial
act, doubtless of the tribes;<a id="FNanchor_2933" href="#Footnote_2933" class="fnanchor">[2933]</a> and in 35 the honors bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span>
upon Octavia and Livia probably came through a plebiscite,
as did certainly the triumph voted to Octavianus.<a id="FNanchor_2934" href="#Footnote_2934" class="fnanchor">[2934]</a> Last may
be mentioned the law of L. Saenius, consul in 30, supported
by a senatus consultum, which empowered Octavianus to create
new patricians.<a id="FNanchor_2935" href="#Footnote_2935" class="fnanchor">[2935]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE COMPOSITION AND PRESERVATION OF STATUTES, COMITIAL PROCEDURE, AND COMITIAL DAYS</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>I. <i>The Composition and Preservation of Statutes</i></h4>

<p>Laws were drawn up in technically exact language. If the
proposer of a rogation lacked the necessary knowledge, he
sought the advice of learned friends.<a id="FNanchor_2936" href="#Footnote_2936" class="fnanchor">[2936]</a> The bill, as first presented
to the senate and published in the city on wooden tablets,<a id="FNanchor_2937" href="#Footnote_2937" class="fnanchor">[2937]</a>
was merely tentative; for discussion in the senate or the
expression of public opinion might suggest changes<a id="FNanchor_2938" href="#Footnote_2938" class="fnanchor">[2938]</a> or even
induce the author to withdraw the proposal.<a id="FNanchor_2939" href="#Footnote_2939" class="fnanchor">[2939]</a></p>

<p>At the head of the law after its adoption was inserted the index
and praescriptio,<a id="FNanchor_2940" href="#Footnote_2940" class="fnanchor">[2940]</a> of which the consular lex Quinctia de
aquaeductibus, accepted by the tribes in the year 9 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, offers
a good example:<a id="FNanchor_2941" href="#Footnote_2941" class="fnanchor">[2941]</a></p>

<p>“T. Quinctius Crispinus consul populum iure rogavit, populusque
iure scivit in foro pro rostris aedis divi Iulii pr(idie) <i>K</i>
Iulias. Tribus Sergia principium fuit, pro tribu Sex.... L. f.
Virro <i>primus scivit</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_2942" href="#Footnote_2942" class="fnanchor">[2942]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span></p>

<p>It contains the name of the rogator,<a id="FNanchor_2943" href="#Footnote_2943" class="fnanchor">[2943]</a> his office, the body of
citizens, whether populus or plebs, to which the proposal is
offered, the place of the assembly,<a id="FNanchor_2944" href="#Footnote_2944" class="fnanchor">[2944]</a> the date, the century (praerogativa)
or the tribe or curia (principium) which voted first,
and the name of the citizen who has been granted the honor of
casting the first vote for his praerogativa or principium.<a id="FNanchor_2945" href="#Footnote_2945" class="fnanchor">[2945]</a> If the
senate has given its sanction, that fact is indicated by the insertion
of the phrase “de s(enatus) s(ententia).”<a id="FNanchor_2946" href="#Footnote_2946" class="fnanchor">[2946]</a> In case the proposal
is by a tribune of the plebs, it is strictly a plebi scitum;
but that its equivalence to a lex may be made clear, it is described
as a lex plebeive scitum.<a id="FNanchor_2947" href="#Footnote_2947" class="fnanchor">[2947]</a></p>

<p>The body of the law is divided into chapters separated by
spaces, sometimes numbered, and occasionally bearing individual
titles.<a id="FNanchor_2948" href="#Footnote_2948" class="fnanchor">[2948]</a> Last comes the sanction,<a id="FNanchor_2949" href="#Footnote_2949" class="fnanchor">[2949]</a> which provides for the
enforcement. Some laws, however,—termed leges imperfectae—lack
this part.<a id="FNanchor_2950" href="#Footnote_2950" class="fnanchor">[2950]</a> Usually the sanction prescribes the form of
procedure according to which offenders are to be tried.<a id="FNanchor_2951" href="#Footnote_2951" class="fnanchor">[2951]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span></p>

<p>If the author of the new proposal has no desire to disturb any
existing law, this fact is indicated by the insertion of the formula
E(x) H(ac) L(ege) N(ihilum) R(ogatur).<a id="FNanchor_2952" href="#Footnote_2952" class="fnanchor">[2952]</a> As a protection from
the operation of earlier laws left in whole or in part unrepealed
by the new statute, the latter is provided with a declaration that
no attempt is hereby made to legalize anything illegal.<a id="FNanchor_2953" href="#Footnote_2953" class="fnanchor">[2953]</a> By an
analogous statement unconscious trespassing upon the rights of
religion is rendered harmless.<a id="FNanchor_2954" href="#Footnote_2954" class="fnanchor">[2954]</a> In accordance with a law of
the Twelve Tables<a id="FNanchor_2955" href="#Footnote_2955" class="fnanchor">[2955]</a> provision is further made against the consequences
of conflict with other laws by the declaration that if
any one in carrying out this law shall trespass against other
statutes or senatus consulta, his act shall render him in no way
liable to such earlier laws or decrees.<a id="FNanchor_2956" href="#Footnote_2956" class="fnanchor">[2956]</a> A provision may also be
added against illegal alteration or repeal.<a id="FNanchor_2957" href="#Footnote_2957" class="fnanchor">[2957]</a> Sometimes the proposer
includes an article for compelling senators and magistrates
to uphold his law, should it be enacted,<a id="FNanchor_2958" href="#Footnote_2958" class="fnanchor">[2958]</a> or for otherwise overcoming
opposition to its enforcement,<a id="FNanchor_2959" href="#Footnote_2959" class="fnanchor">[2959]</a> or for making repeal difficult.<a id="FNanchor_2960" href="#Footnote_2960" class="fnanchor">[2960]</a>
It becomes binding from the moment when the author
announces its adoption by the comitia, excepting in case time
has to be given the senators and magistrates for swearing to it.<a id="FNanchor_2961" href="#Footnote_2961" class="fnanchor">[2961]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[465]</span>
The law is then engraved on a bronze tablet,<a id="FNanchor_2962" href="#Footnote_2962" class="fnanchor">[2962]</a> the original copy
of which is kept by the quaestors in the aerarium.<a id="FNanchor_2963" href="#Footnote_2963" class="fnanchor">[2963]</a> Other
copies are posted in public places where all can read it.<a id="FNanchor_2964" href="#Footnote_2964" class="fnanchor">[2964]</a></p>

<h4>II. <i>Comitial Procedure</i></h4>

<p>The tribal assembly convened under the presidency of a tribune
or aedile of the plebs,<a id="FNanchor_2965" href="#Footnote_2965" class="fnanchor">[2965]</a> in which case the gathering was
technically the plebs;<a id="FNanchor_2966" href="#Footnote_2966" class="fnanchor">[2966]</a> or as the populus under a patrician
magistrate—dictator, consul, praetor,<a id="FNanchor_2967" href="#Footnote_2967" class="fnanchor">[2967]</a> curule aedile,<a id="FNanchor_2968" href="#Footnote_2968" class="fnanchor">[2968]</a> pontifex
maximus,<a id="FNanchor_2969" href="#Footnote_2969" class="fnanchor">[2969]</a> or any extraordinary magistrate who possessed the
ius agendi cum populo.<a id="FNanchor_2970" href="#Footnote_2970" class="fnanchor">[2970]</a> It met indifferently within or without
the pomerium, usually on the Capitoline hill in the precinct of
the temple of Jupiter,<a id="FNanchor_2971" href="#Footnote_2971" class="fnanchor">[2971]</a> in the Forum and comitium,<a id="FNanchor_2972" href="#Footnote_2972" class="fnanchor">[2972]</a> the Campus
Martius,<a id="FNanchor_2973" href="#Footnote_2973" class="fnanchor">[2973]</a> and within the latter in the Flaminian meadow or Flaminian
Circus.<a id="FNanchor_2974" href="#Footnote_2974" class="fnanchor">[2974]</a> Meetings called by tribunes had to convene
within the first milestone, which bounded the authority of these
officials,<a id="FNanchor_2975" href="#Footnote_2975" class="fnanchor">[2975]</a> whereas we hear of a tribal assembly called by a consul
in the military camp at Sutrium (357).<a id="FNanchor_2976" href="#Footnote_2976" class="fnanchor">[2976]</a> The contio, described
in an earlier chapter, was transformed into comitia by
order of the presiding magistrate directing the people to take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span>
their places in their respective tribes.<a id="FNanchor_2977" href="#Footnote_2977" class="fnanchor">[2977]</a> Before this command
was given a tribe was drawn by lot to receive the Latins who
were at Rome.<a id="FNanchor_2978" href="#Footnote_2978" class="fnanchor">[2978]</a> A second tribe was then drawn as a principium
to cast the first vote.<a id="FNanchor_2979" href="#Footnote_2979" class="fnanchor">[2979]</a> The bringing of the urn<a id="FNanchor_2980" href="#Footnote_2980" class="fnanchor">[2980]</a> and the
sortition were the last acts of the contio. To facilitate the
division ropes were stretched across the Forum or other assembly-place,
forming as many compartments as there were tribes.<a id="FNanchor_2981" href="#Footnote_2981" class="fnanchor">[2981]</a>
In time a permanent enclosure, termed Saepta,<a id="FNanchor_2982" href="#Footnote_2982" class="fnanchor">[2982]</a> was built for
the comitia.<a id="FNanchor_2983" href="#Footnote_2983" class="fnanchor">[2983]</a> If the magistrate found that an entire tribe was
absent, he assigned to it for the occasion a few citizens from
some other, in order that in theory all thirty-five tribes—the
universus populus Romanus—might be present.<a id="FNanchor_2984" href="#Footnote_2984" class="fnanchor">[2984]</a> After the
tribes were assembled in their comitia as here described, the principium
was called to vote. This point terminated the right of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span>
intercession<a id="FNanchor_2985" href="#Footnote_2985" class="fnanchor">[2985]</a> and of obnuntiating an evil omen discovered in
watching the sky.<a id="FNanchor_2986" href="#Footnote_2986" class="fnanchor">[2986]</a> When the suffrage of the principium was
given and announced,<a id="FNanchor_2987" href="#Footnote_2987" class="fnanchor">[2987]</a> all the remaining tribes voted simultaneously.<a id="FNanchor_2988" href="#Footnote_2988" class="fnanchor">[2988]</a>
In earlier time a rogator stood at the exit of each
saeptum, and received the oral votes of the citizens as they
passed out one by one.<a id="FNanchor_2989" href="#Footnote_2989" class="fnanchor">[2989]</a> After the introduction of the ballot,<a id="FNanchor_2990" href="#Footnote_2990" class="fnanchor">[2990]</a>
the state provided little tablets inscribed with abbreviations for
“ut rogas” and “antiquo” for affirmative and negative votes
respectively,<a id="FNanchor_2991" href="#Footnote_2991" class="fnanchor">[2991]</a> and for elections blank tablets on which the names
of the candidates could be written.<a id="FNanchor_2992" href="#Footnote_2992" class="fnanchor">[2992]</a> They were deposited in
boxes (cistae) placed at the exits above mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_2993" href="#Footnote_2993" class="fnanchor">[2993]</a> under the
charge of rogatores, who, having lost their original function,
were now often, and more aptly, called custodes.<a id="FNanchor_2994" href="#Footnote_2994" class="fnanchor">[2994]</a> They counted
(diribitio) the ballots, and reported (renuntiatio) the results to
the president.<a id="FNanchor_2995" href="#Footnote_2995" class="fnanchor">[2995]</a> The latter had a right to announce to the public
the returns from the tribes in whatever order he pleased,
but he usually preferred to determine the succession by lot.<a id="FNanchor_2996" href="#Footnote_2996" class="fnanchor">[2996]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[468]</span>
In the election of any college of magistrates each citizen voted
for as many candidates as there were places to be filled, and the
announcements for each continued till a majority was reached
in his favor. Precedence in honor within the college depended
upon priority of election.<a id="FNanchor_2997" href="#Footnote_2997" class="fnanchor">[2997]</a> The declaration of the vote by the
praeco at the command of the president closed the comitial act.<a id="FNanchor_2998" href="#Footnote_2998" class="fnanchor">[2998]</a>
If for any reason the presiding magistrate discontinued the
announcement before a majority was reached, the vote was
without effect.<a id="FNanchor_2999" href="#Footnote_2999" class="fnanchor">[2999]</a> The session of any assembly had to begin and
end between sunrise and sunset.<a id="FNanchor_3000" href="#Footnote_3000" class="fnanchor">[3000]</a></p>

<p>The comitia curiata, presided over by the king, the interrex,
and possibly by the tribunus celerum,<a id="FNanchor_3001" href="#Footnote_3001" class="fnanchor">[3001]</a> and in the republican
period by the dictator,<a id="FNanchor_3002" href="#Footnote_3002" class="fnanchor">[3002]</a> consul,<a id="FNanchor_3003" href="#Footnote_3003" class="fnanchor">[3003]</a> interrex,<a id="FNanchor_3004" href="#Footnote_3004" class="fnanchor">[3004]</a> praetor,<a id="FNanchor_3005" href="#Footnote_3005" class="fnanchor">[3005]</a> pontifex
maximus,<a id="FNanchor_3006" href="#Footnote_3006" class="fnanchor">[3006]</a> or rex sacrorum,<a id="FNanchor_3007" href="#Footnote_3007" class="fnanchor">[3007]</a> met always within the pomerium,<a id="FNanchor_3008" href="#Footnote_3008" class="fnanchor">[3008]</a>
usually in the comitium,<a id="FNanchor_3009" href="#Footnote_3009" class="fnanchor">[3009]</a> or for religious purposes in front
of the Curia Calabra on the Capitoline hill.<a id="FNanchor_3010" href="#Footnote_3010" class="fnanchor">[3010]</a> It was called
together by a curiate lictor<a id="FNanchor_3011" href="#Footnote_3011" class="fnanchor">[3011]</a> at the sound of the lituus or tuba.<a id="FNanchor_3012" href="#Footnote_3012" class="fnanchor">[3012]</a>
The procedure, which in general was like that of the tribal
assembly, and which has been touched upon in the chapters on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span>
the comitia calata and curiata, does not require further consideration
here.<a id="FNanchor_3013" href="#Footnote_3013" class="fnanchor">[3013]</a></p>

<p>The comitia centuriata could be summoned for voting by no
magistrates in their own name and under their own auspices
excepting those who were vested with the imperium<a id="FNanchor_3014" href="#Footnote_3014" class="fnanchor">[3014]</a>—the
dictator, consul, interrex for holding elections, the praetor for
judicial business,<a id="FNanchor_3015" href="#Footnote_3015" class="fnanchor">[3015]</a> and all extraordinary magistrates with consular
power. The duoviri perduellioni iudicandae, the quaestors,
and the tribunes of the plebs could summon this assembly for
judicial business under the auspices only of a magistrate cum
imperio, as the consul or more especially the praetor.<a id="FNanchor_3016" href="#Footnote_3016" class="fnanchor">[3016]</a> It always
met outside the pomerium, usually in the Campus Martius,<a id="FNanchor_3017" href="#Footnote_3017" class="fnanchor">[3017]</a> at
the call of an accensus, who sounded the trumpet (classicum) at
daybreak along the city wall.<a id="FNanchor_3018" href="#Footnote_3018" class="fnanchor">[3018]</a> During the session the citizens
in the assembly could see a flag waving above the Janiculum to
signify that this post was occupied by a garrison as a protection
for the city while they were engaged outside in a public duty.<a id="FNanchor_3019" href="#Footnote_3019" class="fnanchor">[3019]</a>
As in the case of the tribal assembly, the contio was transformed
into comitia by an order of the president commanding the citizens
to separate into their respective voting groups.<a id="FNanchor_3020" href="#Footnote_3020" class="fnanchor">[3020]</a> The place
of meeting, termed ovile<a id="FNanchor_3021" href="#Footnote_3021" class="fnanchor">[3021]</a> (sheepfold), was divided by ropes or
wooden fences into as many compartments as there were centuries
in the largest voting division—probably eighty-seven.<a id="FNanchor_3022" href="#Footnote_3022" class="fnanchor">[3022]</a>
An elevated passage (pons) formed the exit of each compartment.<a id="FNanchor_3023" href="#Footnote_3023" class="fnanchor">[3023]</a>
The members of a century, while passing out one by
one, gave their votes to the rogator, in the same way as the
tribesmen in the comitia tributa. After the ballot was introduced,
it was used in all assemblies alike.<a id="FNanchor_3024" href="#Footnote_3024" class="fnanchor">[3024]</a> The order of voting
before and after the reform has been sufficiently explained in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span>
an earlier chapter.<a id="FNanchor_3025" href="#Footnote_3025" class="fnanchor">[3025]</a> In general the principles governing the
announcement of votes, interruptions, and adjournments were
the same for all three assemblies. The length of the assemblies
must have varied according to the form of organization,
the number of voters present, and various other circumstances.
In the time of Caesar the process in the comitia centuriata, on
an occasion in which there was no delay, lasted five hours.<a id="FNanchor_3026" href="#Footnote_3026" class="fnanchor">[3026]</a>
We should therefore assume at least an hour for the voting of
the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_3027" href="#Footnote_3027" class="fnanchor">[3027]</a></p>

<h4>III. <i>Comitial Days</i></h4>

<p>The people could meet for voting on comitial days only<a id="FNanchor_3028" href="#Footnote_3028" class="fnanchor">[3028]</a>—marked
<b class="sans">C</b> in the calendar.<a id="FNanchor_3029" href="#Footnote_3029" class="fnanchor">[3029]</a> They excluded the dies nefasti—marked
<b class="sans">N</b>, <b class="sans">NP</b>, or <b class="sans">NF</b>—on which religion forbade that public
business should be done.<a id="FNanchor_3030" href="#Footnote_3030" class="fnanchor">[3030]</a> They excluded further the two days
marked Q(uando) R(ex) C(omitiavit) F(as),<a id="FNanchor_3031" href="#Footnote_3031" class="fnanchor">[3031]</a> the one day marked
Q(uando) ST(ercus) D(eletum) F(as)<a id="FNanchor_3032" href="#Footnote_3032" class="fnanchor">[3032]</a>—because on these days
it was impossible to open the assembly in the morning as usage
prescribed—and the eight days marked <b class="sans">EN</b>,<a id="FNanchor_3033" href="#Footnote_3033" class="fnanchor">[3033]</a> the morning and
evening of which were alone nefasti, the intervening part being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a>[471]</span>
free for business. Equally distinct from the comitial days were
the dies fasti non comitiales, marked <b class="sans">F</b>, and in this volume
termed simply fasti.<a id="FNanchor_3034" href="#Footnote_3034" class="fnanchor">[3034]</a> They were reserved for judicial business.
The pre-Julian year contained a hundred and eight nefasti<a id="FNanchor_3035" href="#Footnote_3035" class="fnanchor">[3035]</a> and
forty-five fasti, leaving a hundred and ninety-one comitial days.<a id="FNanchor_3036" href="#Footnote_3036" class="fnanchor">[3036]</a>
The ten days added by Caesar are all marked <b class="sans">F</b>.<a id="FNanchor_3037" href="#Footnote_3037" class="fnanchor">[3037]</a> It is to be
noticed, however, that those days marked <b class="sans">C</b> on which fell in
any year extraordinary or changeable festivals were thereby
rendered unfit for comitia.<a id="FNanchor_3038" href="#Footnote_3038" class="fnanchor">[3038]</a></p>

<p>It seems probable that in early time market-days (nundinae)
were not wholly devoted to trade<a id="FNanchor_3039" href="#Footnote_3039" class="fnanchor">[3039]</a> and to the settlement of cases
at law,<a id="FNanchor_3040" href="#Footnote_3040" class="fnanchor">[3040]</a> but that they could be used equally well for voting
assemblies,<a id="FNanchor_3041" href="#Footnote_3041" class="fnanchor">[3041]</a> till the Hortensian statute of 287 declared those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472"></a>[472]</span>
marked <b class="sans">F</b> and <b class="sans">C</b> to be fasti, reserving them thus for judicial
business and prohibiting from them voting assemblies of every
kind.<a id="FNanchor_3042" href="#Footnote_3042" class="fnanchor">[3042]</a> The general tendency during the republic was to
restrict the power of the people by lessening the number of
days on which they could meet for passing resolutions.<a id="FNanchor_3043" href="#Footnote_3043" class="fnanchor">[3043]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">A SUMMARY OF COMITIAL HISTORY</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Originating in the simple gathering (contio) of the primitive
folk, the general assembly of Roman citizens came, under sacerdotal
influence, to be grouped in curiae with a view to adding
order and solemnity to the meetings. Thus the Romans created
the comitia curiata. Not only the curiae, but also the later centuries,
classes, and tribes, originally existed independently of
the assembly for various administrative purposes and were
brought into connection with that institution as convenient systems
of organization. At first ceremonial, the comitia curiata
came to be used for voting on resolutions. Gradually reducing
this earliest organized gathering to a formality, the Romans
successively introduced the centuriate and the tribal comitia.
Excepting for brief, transitional periods the assembly, whatever
its form, admitted all citizens who possessed the right of suffrage.
Its power was at first slight vague, and chiefly receptive.
Though in the regal period the people occasionally
approved or rejected judicial sentences, administrative plans,
and even proposals for changes in existing customs submitted
to them by the king of his own free will, the only function
which at that time they definitely acquired was the election of
their chief magistrate.</p>

<p>From the founding of the republic to the decemviral legislation
(509-450) the magistrates and senate exercised almost absolute
control over the administration. At the very beginning
the comitia centuriata—a newly established timocratic institution—assumed
the right to enact laws, which for a long time
were substantially limited to matters directly affecting the constitution;
and the alleged Valerian centuriate statute made of
this body a supreme court to which any citizen condemned on a
capital charge was granted the privilege of appeal. In practice,
however, the law benefited those only of high rank who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474"></a>[474]</span>
accused of political crimes. Meantime a new, more democratic
assembly under the presidency of tribunes of the plebs, meeting
by tribes after 471, usurped an extensive though ill-defined
power of fining and capitally condemning offenders against the
sanctity of plebeian officials. But this function, resting upon
an act of the plebs only and enforced by threats of violence,
was almost nullified by patrician opposition. It was doubtless
in this period that voting by heads arose in the comitia centuriata,
whence it was adopted by the other assemblies.</p>

<p>The Twelve Tables (451-450) confirmed the comitia centuriata
in the rights it had previously assumed; and if not expressly,
at least by implication they granted legislative and judicial power
to the tribunician assembly of tribes. A Valerian-Horatian
statute of 449 provided that resolutions approved by the senate
and carried by the latter assembly should have the force of law,
just as from the beginning the senatorial sanction (patrum auctoritas)
was essential to the validity of curiate and centuriate
resolutions and elections. At the same time in conformity
with a law of the Twelve Tables an arrangement was made by
which the tribunes should bring their finable actions before the
tribes and those of a capital nature before the centuries. Soon
afterward the patrician magistrates began to use the tribes for
the election of inferior officials and occasionally for the ratification
of laws.</p>

<p>During the century following the decemviral legislation (450-358)
the almost absolute administrative power of the senate and
magistrates remained but slightly affected by the comitia. The
appointment of a dictator or the establishment of a special judicial
commission placed the citizens at the mercy of the government.
Although the comitia centuriata acquired the right to
ratify or reject declarations of offensive war (427) and though
the tribunes succeeded in enacting a few important plebiscites,
like the Canuleian and the Licinian-Sextian, the people made
little progress toward the free exercise of legislative and judicial
functions. With the enactment of a lex de ambitu in 358 the
tribes began to legislate concerning magistrates, with reference
not only to candidacy and qualifications but soon also to powers
and functions and to the creation of new offices. They passed
laws on finance and religion and on the qualification and appointment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[475]</span>
of senators; they assumed the function of ratifying
or rejecting proposals for peace (321) and of admitting aliens
to citizenship. The tribes and the centuries began regularly to
exercise appellate jurisdiction. About the same time the people
acquired the function of appointing special judicial commissions,
and subjected the dictator to the law of appeal. In an effort
to throw off the control exercised by the nobility the Publilian
statute of 339 excluded patricians from the tribunician assembly
of tribes (a regulation afterward silently abandoned), and in 287
that of Hortensius rendered the approval of the senate and of
the patrician portion of it unessential to the validity of the plebiscite.
Meanwhile in administrative and in constitutional legislation
the comitia tributa made great gains at the expense of
the senate and magistrates and of the centuriate assembly.</p>

<p>The period extending from 358 to 287 was accordingly the
first great age of comitial legislative and judicial activity. The
strong popular tendency then manifested might have created a
real democracy, had it not been for (1) the cleverness of the
nobles in gaining control of the plebeian tribunate and in using
religion as a check on comitial freedom. (2) the rapid expansion
of the Roman power, which drew the public mind away from
internal politics, and which rendered the assembly not only an
inadequate representative of the citizens but also incompetent
for the functions devolving upon it. Many years passed, however,
before this incompetency became serious. Though henceforth
the comitia were in theory sovereign, they remained limited
by a want of initiative both in the act of assembling and in the
offering of resolutions, by the lack of free deliberation, by the
tribunician veto, and by the oblative auspices. After the enactment
of the Hortensian statute the comitia tributa enjoyed almost
exclusive possession of the legislative function. The larger
share fell to the tribunician assembly, which excelled in aggressiveness,
and which admitted as much freedom of debate as was
consistent with the spirit of the constitution—hence it was
preferably termed concilium. Notwithstanding these relative
advantages of the tribal assembly the adverse conditions above
mentioned led to an era of comitial stagnation (287-232), at the
close of which the tribunate of C. Flaminius brought a new outburst
of activity (232-201). The assemblies now recovered all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476"></a>[476]</span>
they had lost in the preceding age and made fresh gains. Noteworthy
are the sumptuary, monetary, private, and family statutes,
and the recognition of the right of the people to grant
dispensations from existing laws. In the opinion of Polybius
the constitution was in this time at its best. The nobles admitted
the theory of popular sovereignty, as they could well
afford to do in view of their thorough control of all governmental
institutions. In the era of the completed plutocracy
(201-134) they regularly resorted to the comitia in matters of
little political importance or in those in which they felt certain
of the results. Under these conditions fewer laws were enacted
for the benefit of the masses. The policy of the nobles was to
repress individual freedom by subjecting both magistrates and
assemblies to the plutocratic machine. Even the comitial judicia
were subordinated to this end; and toward the close of
the period the people in establishing permanent courts began
through legislation to surrender their judicial power to the
senatorial class, while the senate, on the other hand, resumed
the function of dispensing from the laws and of appointing special
courts. In these ways the nobility was making great inroads
on popular liberty.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the revolutionary period (134-30) the
tribal assembly, liberated for a time from servitude to the plutocracy,
became under the presidency of reforming tribunes the
ruling power at Rome. Its activity not only embraced the
whole field of administration but was directed by the Gracchi
to the creation of a new political constitution and to the regeneration
of society. But its variable composition precluded consistency
of action. Though at times, as when controlled by the
rural element of the citizen body, it could be induced to adopt
liberal, statesmanlike measures such as the agrarian and colonial
laws of the Gracchi, the usual dominance of the ignorant and
unprincipled poor of the metropolis inclined it to a short-sighted,
selfish course of conduct—rendering it a powerful weapon in
the hands either of the demagogue or of the plutocratic senate,
equally effective for resisting genuine reforms and for destroying
the institutions of the republic. As with the progress of
the revolution the conservative checks began to weaken and
disappear, the comitia became more and more subject to violence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span>
and coercion. The comitial prosecutions of this period
partook of the same revolutionary character. From the time
of Sulla the assemblies were overshadowed by the military
power. Under his dictation they surrendered to the senatorial
courts nearly all that remained of their judicial function, and
they seriously crippled their legislative power in favor of a reaction
to the pre-Hortensian constitution. After a brief interval
of bondage to the senate (81-70) they recovered their legislative
freedom, only to subserve for the future the alliance now formed
between the tribunes of the plebs and the great proconsuls.
From the accession of Julius Cæesar to the dictatorship (49)
their power rapidly declined. They yielded to him a large
share of their legislative and even of their elective function.
After a brief period of pretended liberty following the assassination
of the dictator, they lapsed with the fall of the republic
into utter insignificance.</p>

<p>The comitia had filled a large place in the history of the state.
They were the chief factor of constitutional progress and of
beneficent legislation. Their development and decline involved
the prosperity and the ruin of the republic. For the world they
have a higher value. The tribal assembly, supporting the plebeian
tribunate, was the storm centre of long, heroic struggles
for human rights. The fact that it championed this cause, that
it met with some success in the conflict, that a Gracchus deemed
it worthy to undertake the social regeneration of the world, has
given the institution a universal and a permanent interest.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> The original seat of the hero at Rome was on the Capitoline near the site of
the later temple of Juno Moneta; Plut. <i>Rom.</i> 20. It was closely connected, therefore,
with the auguraculum on the spot; Varro, <i>L. L.</i> v. 47; Cic. <i>Off.</i> iii. 16. 66;
Fest. ep. 16. Perhaps his name has some etymological relation with titiare, “to
chirp as a sparrow”; Varro, <i>L. L.</i> v. 85 (titiis avibus); Pais, <i>Storia di Roma</i>, I. i.
277 and n. 3; Forcellini, <i>Lex.</i> s. v. The Sodales Titii, who attended to his worship
(cf. Dion. Hal. ii. 52. 5; Tac. <i>Ann.</i> i. 54; <i>Hist.</i> ii. 95) were accustomed to take a
certain kind of auspices from birds; Varro, ibid. His tomb was in a place called
Lauretum on the Aventine (Pais, ibid. 279), confused probably with Laurentum,
where he is said to have been killed. All these circumstances indicate that Titus
Tatius was an indigenous Roman, or at most a Latin hero, and that his connection
with the Sabines is an ill-founded, relatively late idea. The primary origin of the
word Titienses is Etruscan; Schulze, <i>Lat. Eigennam.</i> 218.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> Possibly because the rites of the Titian sodales seemed to be Sabine (cf. Tac.
<i>Ann.</i> i. 54); but even if they were, this circumstance would not make the Titian
tribe Sabine.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> Varro, however, placed them on the Aventine. A Sabine settlement on the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> Proposed by Niebuhr, <i>Röm. Gesch.</i> i. 311 ff., English, i. 153 ff. In his opinion
the three tribes were of different nationalities. His view, with or without the theory
of national syncretism, has been accepted by many scholars, including Schwegler,
<i>Röm. Gesch.</i> i. 480 ff., 497-514; Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i> i. 82 ff.; Peter, <i>Gesch. Roms.</i>
i. 60; Madvig, <i>Röm. Staat.</i> i. 97 f.; Herzog, <i>Röm. Staatsverf.</i> i. 23 f. (with some

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> Against the view that the three tribes were once independent communities are
Volquardsen, in <i>Rhein. Mus.</i> xxxiii. 542 ff.; Meyer, <i>Gesch. d. Alt.</i> ii. 510; Lécrivain,
in Daremberg et Saglio, <i>Dict.</i> ii. 1514 a; Holzapfel, in <i>Beitr. z. alt. Gesch.</i> i. 241,
249 ff.; Platner, <i>Top. and Mon. of Anc. Rome</i>, 33. Ihne, <i>Hist. of Rome</i>, i. 114,
thinks they probably had reference only to the army. The double nature of many
Roman institutions—a phenomenon on which scholars chiefly rely for their theory
of a once existent two-tribe state—may better be explained by the union of the
Sabines with the Romans after the institution of the three tribes; as this relatively
later date would at the same time explain the six-fold character of various institutions.
That the union took place at the beginning of the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> is believed by
Pais, <i>Storia di Roma</i>, I. i. 277. Or the stated increase in the number of members of
the vestals, augurs, pontiffs, and more particularly of senators, may be due to an
ancient theory, dimly hinted at in the sources, of an admission of the second and
third tribes successively to representation in these bodies; cf. Niebuhr, <i>Röm. Gesch.</i>
i. 320 f., English, i. 157; Bloch, <i>Orig. d. sén.</i> 32 ff.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> Bormann, in <i>Eran. Vind.</i> 345-58, following a hint offered by Niese, <i>Röm.
Gesch.</i> (1st ed. 1886) 585, has gone so far as to deny their existence, setting them
down as an invention of Varro; but Holzapfel, in <i>Beitr. z. alt. Gesch.</i> i. 230 ff.,
proves that Cicero and other sources did not draw from Varro their information
regarding the tribes. Against Bormann, see also Pais, ibid. I. i. 279, n. 1.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> That the primitive Roman tribes were in character substantially identical with
the primitive Greek phylae cannot be doubted. Apparently the four Ionic phylae
in Attica offered no resistance to dissolution at the hands of Cleisthenes; cf. Hdt. v.
66; Arist. <i>Ath. Pol.</i> 21. (For the best treatment of the Greek phylae, see Szanto,
E., <i>Ausgewählte Abhandlungen</i>, 216-88, who maintains that the institution was artificial.)
In like manner the three Roman tribes disappeared, leaving but scant traces;
p. 7.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> Mantua, till late an Etruscan city, had three tribes; Serv. <i>in Aen.</i> x. 202. In
this connection it is significant that Volnius, an Etruscan poet, declared the primitive
tribal names to be Etruscan; Varro, <i>L. L.</i> v. 55. The information suggests the
possibility that some Etruscan cities had these same tribes; cf. Fest. 285. 25;
<i>CIL.</i> ix. 4204 (locality unknown). In fact these names can be ultimately traced to
Etruscan gentilicia; Schulze, <i>Lat. Eigennam.</i> 218, 581. The triplet champions of
Alba point to a division of this community into three tribes; Niebuhr, <i>Röm. Gesch.</i>
i. 386; Schwegler, <i>Röm. Gesch.</i> i. 502. The story that T. Tatius was killed at
Lavinium indicates the existence of a tomb of the hero in that place—a clear sign
of a tribe of Tities there; Livy i. 14. 2; Dion. Hal. ii. 52; cf. Varro, <i>L. L.</i> v. 152.
A trace of Ramnes is found at Ardea; Serv. <i>in Aen.</i> ix. 358. There were Ramnennii
in Ostia (<i>CIL.</i> xiv. 1542) and Ramnii in Capua; ibid. x. 3772; Schulze, <i>Lat.
Eigennam.</i> 218. The existence of a tribe of Luceres in Ardea is vouched for by
Lucerus, its eponymous hero, king of that city; Fest. ep. 119; Pais, <i>Storia di Roma</i>,
I. i. 279. The word in various forms occurs in certain Etruscan towns; Schulze,
ibid. 182. These facts make it probable that some at least of the Latin as well as
Etruscan cities had the same three tribes.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> The Etruscans had twelve cities in each of their three districts; Strabo v. 4. 3;
Livy v. 33. Each city had three consecrated gates and three temples to Jupiter,
Juno, and Minerva; Serv. <i>in Aen.</i> i. 422. The Umbrians had three hundred cities
in the Po valley, destroyed by the Etruscans; Pliny, <i>N. H.</i> iii. 14. 113. The Bruttians
were organized in a confederation of twelve cities; Livy xxv. 1. 2. The Iapygians
were divided into three branches (Polyb. iii. 88. 4), each of which comprised
twelve smaller groups; Bloch, <i>Orig. d. sén.</i> 9 f.; Holzapfel, in <i>Beitr. z. alt. Gesch.</i>
i. 245 ff., 252 f. The tripartite division also existed in many pagi which continued
to historical time; Kornemann, in <i>Klio</i>, v. 83.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> These facts are too well known to need illustration; cf. Nissen, <i>Templum</i>, 144;
Bloch, <i>Orig. d. sén.</i> 1 ff.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> Varro, <i>L. L.</i> v. 55. Tribus = tri-bu-s: bu- is related to φυ- “to grow,” Skt.
bhū-; tribus, corresponding to φυ-λή, would then signify “three-branch;” Corssen,
<i>Ausspr.</i> i. 163; Pott, <i>Etym. Forsch.</i> i. 111, 217; ii. 441; Vaniček, <i>Etym. Wörterb.
d. lat. Spr.</i> 69; <i>Griech.-lat. etym. Wörterb.</i> 636; Bloch, ibid. 9. Schlossman, in
<i>Archiv f. lat. Lexicog.</i> xiv (1905). 25-40, connecting tribus with tres, interprets it
not as a third but as an indefinite part, cf. entzweien with the meaning to divide in
several parts. Schrader, <i>Reallex.</i> 801, is doubtful as to the etymology; cf. Walde,
<i>Lat. etym. Wörterb.</i> 636. The connection of the word with tres is denied by Madvig,
<i>Röm. Staat.</i> i. 96; Nissen, <i>Ital. Landesk.</i> ii. 8, n. 5. Christ, in <i>Sitzb. d. bayer. Akad.</i>
1906. 204, prefers to connect it with Celt *trebo- (Old Irish treb), “house,” Goth.
thaúrp, “village.” Oscan trebo- also means “house.”</p>

and the syssition (Dion. Hal. ii. 23. 3; Dio Cass. ibid.). Although the institutions
designated by these four names show considerable variety of form and function, they
are similar in general character and may have a common origin; Meyer, <i>Gesch. d.
Alt.</i> ii. 514.</p>

<p>The myth which names the curiae after the Sabine women suggests that some of
the curial names, and perhaps the curiae themselves, might be found among the
Sabines. On Rapta and Titia however see p. 11, n. 7.</p>

<p>Soltau, <i>Altröm. Volksversamml.</i> 47 f., entertains the peculiar idea that the curiae,
invented to counteract the independent tendencies of the tribes, were not divisions
of the tribes, the members of each curia being drawn from all three tribes. His
view is contradicted by the sources and he admits that he cannot prove it.</p>

<p>St. Augustine, <i>Enarr. in Psalm.</i> 121. 7 (iv. 2. 1624 ed. Migne), and still later
Paulus, the epitomator of Festus, 54, suppose that there were thirty-five curiae. Notwithstanding
Hoffmann, <i>Patr. u. pleb. Cur.</i> 44 ff., the opinion of these late writers
doubtless arose from an identification of the curiae with the tribes; cf. Kübler, in
Pauly-Wissowa, <i>Real-Encycl.</i> iv. 1818.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">[50]</a> The word is derived from *co-viria, “a dwelling together,” “an assembly,” by Pott,
<i>Etym. Forsch.</i> ii. 373 f. (cf. Vaniček, <i>Etym. Wörterb. d. lat. Spr.</i> 160; Walde, <i>Lat. etym.
Wörterb.</i> 161), who is followed by Schwegler, <i>Röm. Gesch.</i> i. 496, n. 8, 610, n. 4;
Herzog, <i>Röm. Staatsverf.</i> i. 96. Mommsen, <i>Röm. Staatsr.</i> iii. 5, 90 and notes, gives
the word the meaning “an association of citizens,” deriving it from quiris (cf. <i>Abriss</i>,
11), which he connects with κῦρος, κῦριος, as did Lange in 1853 (<i>Kleine Schriften</i>, i.
147). Afterward—<i>Röm. Alt.</i> i. (1876) 91—Lange expressed some doubt as to this
connection. But the fact that curia applies to the house not only of the curiales, but
also of the senate and of the Salii, as well as to various other buildings, seems to
indicate that the meaning “house” is primary for the Latin language if not ultimately
original. Corssen, who accepts this meaning, derives cu- from sku-, “to
cover,” “to protect” (<i>Ausspr.</i> i. 353 f.; Vaniček, <i>Griech.-lat. etym. Wörterb.</i> 1116),
cf. Old High Germ. hū-t, hū-s, Eng. “house.” Although Mommsen, <i>Röm. Staatsr.</i>
iii. 90, n. 2, protests against this explanation, it is accepted by Meyer, <i>Gesch. d. Alt.</i>
ii. 511, Soltau, <i>Altröm. Volksversamml.</i> 52, and others. Far less probable is a connection
with cura, curare, assumed by most ancient writers; cf. Varro, <i>L. L.</i> v. 155;
vi. 46; <i>Vit. pop. rom.</i> in Non. Marc. 57; Fest. ep. 49; Pomponius, in <i>Dig.</i> i. 2. 2. 2;
Dio Cass. Frag. 5. 8; Isid. <i>Etym.</i> xv. 2. 28. These sources have misled Genz, <i>Patr.
Rom</i>, 32, into fruitless speculation on the functions of the curia.</p>

afford absolute proof; for Gaius, bk. vi <i>ad legem Duodecim Tabularum</i> (<i>Dig.</i> 1. 16.
238: “Plebs est ceteri cives sine senatoribus”), probably commenting on the very
law quoted by Cicero and Livy, seems to understand patres as senators; cf. the prohibition
of intermarriage between senators and their agnatic descendants on the one
hand and freed persons on the other; <i>Dig.</i> xxii. 2. 44; Roby, <i>Rom. Priv. Law</i>,

In its adjectival and adverbial uses ingenuus connotes not the quality of free birth,
but respectability, nobility. The original meaning is “born within,” hence indigenous,
native; cf. Forcellini, <i>Totius Latinitatis Lexicon</i>, s. v. In this sense it could
not apply to the patricians, who generally claimed a foreign origin. But native is
superior to alien; doubtless in this secondary meaning of excellence it attached to
the nobility, the close relation of the word to gens (family, lineage) attracting it in
that direction. Afterward it was so democratized as to include all the freeborn.
With this meaning we find it as early as Plautus, <i>Mil.</i> 784, 961. According to
Dionysius, ii. 8. 3, the identification of patricii with ingenui in its sense of freeborn
was accepted not by the most trustworthy historians, but by certain malicious
slanderers: “Some say they were called patricians because they alone could cite
their fathers, the rest being fugitives and unable to cite free fathers.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_153" href="#FNanchor_153" class="label">[153]</a> <i>Top.</i> 6. 29: “Gentiles sunt inter se, qui eodem nomine sunt. Non est satis.
Qui ab ingenuis oriundi sunt. Ne id quidem satis est. Quorum maiorum nemo
servitutem servivit. Abest etiam nunc. Qui capite non sunt deminuti. Hoc fortasse
satis est. Nihil enim video Scaevolam pontificem ad hanc definitionem addidisse;”
cf. Cincius, in Fest. ep. 94.</p>

<p>As the word itself indicates, gentiles are members of a gens, and no other
members are known to the sources. If it were true, as Mommsen, <i>Röm. Staatsr.</i> iii.
66, supposes, that there were dependent members not termed gentiles, a name would
have been given this dependent relation, or the jurists would have defined it, or
some ancient writer would at least have mentioned it. The attempt of Kübler,
<i>Wochenschr. f. kl. Philol.</i> xxv (1908). 541 f., to prove, on the authority of Cicero,
<i>Tim.</i> 11. 41, that clients were termed quasi gentiles is simply absurd. The passage
does not even hint at clientage; and the quasi gentiles of the immortal gods, according
to this passage, were related to the gods by birth, as the word gignatis proves.
From this point of view men might be called the children of the gods; but because
the divine element in both men and gods comes alike from the Creator, it is
possible to place them more nearly on a level with one another—in a relation like
that of gentiles. Kübler’s other remarks on the gens, 539-43, are equally unconvincing.</p>

from the beginning the clients belonged to the curia in its administrative capacity,
shared in its sacra, attended its meetings, but did not vote. The plebs, however,
were not even passive members. His reasons do not deserve mention. Vassis,
Ῥωμαών Πολιτεία ἡ βασιλευομένη κα ἡ ἐλευθέρα (Athens, 1903), also excludes the
commons from the curiate assembly throughout its history. The fancies of Hoffmann,
<i>Patr. und pleb. Curien</i>, need not detain us.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_224" href="#FNanchor_224" class="label">[224]</a> Dionysius, i. 85. 3, states that the colonists from Alba were mostly plebeians, but
that a considerable number of the highest nobility accompanied them. It is a significant
fact, however, that no patrician family is known to have derived its origin
from this earliest colony. Those who claimed Alban and Trojan descent preferred
to connect their admission to citizenship with the Roman annexation of Alba Longa,
e.g. the Tullii, Servilii, Quinctii, Geganii, Curiatii, and Cloelii; Livy i. 30. 2. On the
Alban and Sabine origin of most of the nobility, Livy iv. 4. 7. In so far as the local
cognomina are indicative of origin (cf. Willems, <i>Sén. Rom.</i> i. 11 ff.), they point to a
diversity of foreign connections. The Tarquinian gens, which in later time was
thought of as patrician, came from Etruria, ultimately from Greece. The Aemilii
were Greek (Plut. <i>Aem.</i> 1; Fest. ep. 23) or Sabine (Plut. <i>Num.</i> 8) or Oscan (Fest.
130. 1).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_226" href="#FNanchor_226" class="label">[226]</a> That Caere was the first community to receive the civitas sine suffragio may
justly be inferred from the expression “Caerite franchise,” which designates this kind
of limited citizenship (cf. p. 62). The general fact stated in (6) is further confirmed
by the law which granted the right of extending the pomerium to those magistrates
only who had acquired new territory for Rome; Gell. xiii. 14. 3; Tacitus, <i>Ann.</i>
xii. 23.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_227" href="#FNanchor_227" class="label">[227]</a> Since the publication of the <i>Staatsrecht</i>, writers have made slight modifications or
extensions of the conventional theory. Greenidge, in Poste, <i>Gaii Institutiones</i>, xix,
suggests that the dual forms in Roman law may have as their basis a racial distinction
between the patricians and the plebeians. A serious objection to this kind of reasoning
is that if we are on the lookout for dualities, trinities, and the like, we shall find
them in abundance everywhere. All sorts of theories as to the racial connections
of the two social classes have been proposed. Zöller, <i>Latium und Rom</i>, 23 ff.,
supposes that the patricians were Sabine and the plebeians Latin. Ridgeway, <i>Early
Age of Greece</i>, i. 257, holds that the plebeians were Ligurians, whereas Conway, in
<i>Riv. di Stor. ant.</i> vii (1903). 422-4, prefers to consider them Volscians. These notions
are equally worthless. Undoubtedly race is a potent factor in history; but
Gumplowicz, <i>Rassenkampf</i> (1883), has killed the theory by overwork.</p>

<p>Among the writers who have rejected the conventional view are Soltau, <i>Altröm.
Volksversamml.</i> (1880); Bernhöft, <i>Röm. Königsz.</i> (1882); Pelham, <i>Outlines of Roman
History</i> (1893; reprint of his article on “Roman History,” in the <i>Encycl. Brit.</i>);

<p><a id="Footnote_261" href="#FNanchor_261" class="label">[261]</a> The idea that the primitive community is essentially illiberal with its membership
is erroneous. For the mingling of conquerors and conquered, see p. 42 f. and notes.
On the ethnic heterogeneity of states in general, see Gumplowicz, <i>Rassenkampf</i>, 181.
The laws of Solon granted citizenship to alien residents who were in perpetual exile
from their own country, or who had settled with their families in Attica with a view
to plying their trade; Plut. <i>Sol.</i> 24. Under his laws, too, a valid marriage could be
contracted between an Athenian and an alien; Hdt. vi. 130. The Athenians, like
the Romans, believed that many of their noble families were of foreign origin. In
Ireland “strangers settling in the district, conducting themselves well, and intermarrying
with the clan, were after a few generations indistinguishable from it;”
Ginnell, <i>Brehon Laws</i>, 103. Nearly the same rule holds for South Wales; Seebohm,
<i>Tribal System in Wales</i>, 131. To the Germans before their settlement within the
empire the idea of an exclusive community must have been foreign; for as yet the
individual was but loosely attached to his tribe. Persons of many tribes were united
in the comitatus of a chief; the two halves of a tribe often fought on opposite sides
in war; a tribe often chose its chief from another tribe. Intermarriage among the
tribes was common, even between Germans and Sarmatians. A single tribe often
split into several independent tribes, and conversely new tribes were formed of the
most diverse elements; Seeck, <i>Geschichte des Untergangs der antiken Welt</i>, i. 209
with notes; Kaufmann, <i>Die Germanen der Urzeit</i>, 136 f. Under these circumstances
the primitive German community cannot be described as exclusive. In like manner
our sources unanimously testify to the liberality of early Rome in granting the
citizenship to strangers. It is no longer possible to oppose to this authority the
objection that such generosity does not accord with primitive conditions.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_263" href="#FNanchor_263" class="label">[263]</a> Mommsen’s theory of gentile ownership, adopted by Kubitschek, in Pauly-Wissowa,
<i>Real-Encycl.</i> i. 790, depends upon his view that the gens was as old as the
state; in his opinion it was originally stronger but gradually weakened, whereas the
state went through the opposite process; <i>Röm Staatsr.</i> iii. 25. But if, as I have elsewhere
pointed out (<i>Pol. Sci. Quart.</i> xxii. 685 ff.), the gens developed from the family
during the decline of the kingship and the rise of aristocracy, the theory of a primitive
gentile ownership falls to the ground.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_264" href="#FNanchor_264" class="label">[264]</a> We are not to think of the state as granting a certain district to the tribe, which
then parcelled it among the component curiae, etc., for this reason that the tribes and
the curiae did not themselves possess common lands. Rather the state divided a
given district among the families which were already included, or which it wished to
include, in a given curia or tribe. In this way the later tribes were formed in historical
time, and in this way the Claudian tribe was originally constituted; Livy ii.
16. 4 f.; cf. Plut. <i>Popl.</i> 21. When therefore Dionysius, ii. 7. 4, states that Romulus
divided the land into thirty lots and assigned a lot to each of the thirty curiae, he
means, if he correctly understands the matter, that land was assigned not to the curia
as a whole but to the families which composed the curia, unless indeed the curiae
once had a right of landholding not possessed in historical time.</p>

constitution as the tribes, but in that case the difference between pagus and tribus
would be one of name only, and would therefore be without historical significance.
Meyer’s view (<i>Gesch. d. Alt.</i> v. 135, 142) that the sixteen earliest country tribes
were not formed till after the institution of the plebeian tribunate depends partly on
his notion that the tribunes were originally the heads of the four urban tribes and
partly on the difference in the naming, the city tribes being named after localities
and the country tribes after gentes; cf. <i>Hermes</i>, xxx. 11. The latter circumstance,
he asserts, establishes a later origin for the rural tribes. This argument is by no
means convincing; the difference may have arisen from different conditions in
country and city; probably no urban ward had one patrician gens so predominant
as to give its name. If one kind of name is earlier than another, we should
naturally suppose the gentile name to be the earlier, and in that case we should
prefer the view of Pais, <i>Stor. di Rom.</i> I. i. 320, n. 1; <i>Leg. of Rom. Hist.</i> 140; cf.

<p><a id="Footnote_311" href="#FNanchor_311" class="label">[311]</a> Livy ii. 21. 7 (495): “Romae tribus una et xxx factae.” This statement is not
that thirty-one tribes were instituted in that year, but that the number thirty-one
was reached, “factae” being copulative. If “una et xxx” is not a copyist’s error, it
probably depends on the Fabian view that there were originally thirty tribes. At
all events it is inconsistent with the later statement (vi. 5. 8) that the number
twenty-five was not reached till 387. The epitomator of Livy accordingly corrected
the number to twenty-one, which most editors now write in the text itself. That
there were twenty-one tribes in 491, when Coriolanus was tried, is assumed too by
Dion. Hal. vii. 64. 6: Μιᾶς γὰρ καὶ εἴκοσι τότε φυλῶν οὐσῶν, οἶς ἡ ψῆφος ἀνεδόθη, τὰς
ἀπολυούσας φυλὰς ἔσχεν ὁ Μάρκιος ἐννέα· ὤστ’ εἰ δύο προσῆλθον αὐτῷ φυλαί, διὰ τὴν
ἰσοψηφίαν ἀπελέλυτ’ ἄν, ὥσπερ ὁ νόμος ἠξίου (“There being at the time twenty-one
tribes, to whom the vote was given, Marcius received the votes of nine tribes
for acquittal; so that, had two more tribes been favorable, he would have been
acquitted by an equality of votes, as the law required”). This is not a mistake, as
many assume, but an understatement; cf. Müller, J. J., in <i>Philol.</i> xxxiv (1876).
110 f. Meyer’s explanation (<i>Hermes</i>, xxx. 10, n. 2), which makes διὰ τὴν ἰσοψηφλίαν
signify “owing to the equal value of the votes,” is improbable and unnecessary.</p>

available strength, when folk and army have ceased to be identical (Schrader,

adoption of the Servian reform; Delbrück, <i>Gesch d. Kriegsk.</i> i. 225; Smith, ibid.

laden, which would still give the meaning “summoning;” cf. Curtius, <i>Griech. Etym.</i>
139; Vaniček, <i>Griech. Lat. etym. Wörterb.</i> 143 (*cla-t, cla-t-ti-s). Mommsen

it in the <i>Staatsrecht</i>, iii. 262 f. (cf. his <i>History</i>, English ed. i. 1900. 115 f., 118) on
the ground that however adapted it may have been to the later political classes, it
could not well apply to the fleet and army, and hence could not belong to the earlier
use of the word, which denoted the line in contrast with those who fought outside
the line. But against his reasoning it could be urged that classis with the idea of
“summoning” first applied to the line of heavy infantry—the only effective part
of the army; and when once the connotation of “line” had been established, it
could easily extend to the fleet.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_443" href="#FNanchor_443" class="label">[443]</a> This distinction of rank among the patrician centuries of the comitia centuriata
is proved by the expression “proceres patricii” in the Censoriae Tabulae, quoted by
Fest. 249. 1: “Procum patricium in descriptione classium, quam fecit Ser. Tullius,
significat procerum. I enim sunt principes;” Cic. <i>Orat.</i> 46. 156: “Centuriam fabrum
et procum, ut censoriae tabulae loquuntur, audeo dicere, non fabrorum aut procorum.”
Mommsen, <i>Röm. Staatsr.</i> iii. 109, n. 1, has rightly referred it to one of the sex suffragia,
for no century outside this group could have been so designated; cf. Livy ii.
20. 11, who speaks of the cavalry as proceres iuventutis. The mention of a century
of leading patricians implies the existence of one or more centuries of the less distinguished
members of the same rank, which must have been the rest of the sex
suffragia. The superior rank of the equites in early Rome is proved by Dion. Hal.
ii. 13. 1; iv. 18. 1; Livy i. 43. 8 f.; ii. 20. 11. In ii. 24. 2 Livy implies that the
patricians did not serve on foot (militare), and in iii. 27. 1 he speaks of a patrician
who, as an exception among his rank, served on foot because of his poverty. In
ii. 42 f. he distinguishes the cavalry from the infantry as patricians from plebeians.
The fact that in the political conflict between the two social classes the patricians
often threatened to carry on foreign wars with the aid merely of their clients (cf.
Dion. Hal. x. 15, 27 f., 43) proves that the phalanx was essentially plebeian. On the
honorable place of the equites in the camp, see Nitzsch, in <i>Hist. Zeitschr.</i> vii (1862).
145. That the sex suffragia remained patrician down to the reform of the comitia
centuriata is probable; cf. Sallust, <i>Hist.</i> i. 11, who represents the struggle between
the social classes as continuing to the opening of the war with Hannibal; see also
Mommsen, <i>Röm. Staatsr.</i> iii. 254.</p>

must have at least the merit of possibility. The number fifteen is wrong because it

<p><a id="Footnote_460" href="#FNanchor_460" class="label">[460]</a> That the phalanx was a comparatively late institution at Rome, or that it was
slow in becoming the only military system, is indicated by the survival in tradition
of a more primitive mode of warfare. Sometimes in the early republic a single gens
with its clients took the field; for the Fabian gens, see Livy ii. 48 ff. Often the
patricians threatened to arm their clients, to carry on a war without the aid of the
troublesome plebeians; cf. Dion. Hal. x. 15, 27 f., 43. As there was no motive in
later time for the invention of such stories, they must contain a kernel of real tradition;
hence they could not go back to the sixth century, and it is difficult to
believe that they are so old as the fifth.</p>

<p>Collateral evidence that the second and third divisions were instituted relatively
late may be found in the circumstance that the scutum, the distinctive piece of armor
of these divisions, was introduced no earlier than the age of Camillus—the period
of the war with Veii and the Gallic conflagration; Livy viii. 8. 3; Müller-Deecke,
<i>Etrusker</i>, i. 366. It was Samnite (Athen. vi. 106, p. 273 f.; cf. Sall. <i>Cat.</i> 51), and
was therefore probably adopted in the fourth century when Rome first came into

The attempt of Smith, <i>Röm. Timokr.</i>, especially 140 ff., to prove that the five classes
were introduced by the censors of 179 has nothing in its favor. It rests upon Livy
xl. 51. 9: “Mutarunt suffragia, regionatimque generibus hominum causisque et
quaestibus tribus descripserunt.” This passage makes no reference to the classes. In
“generibus hominum” are included chiefly the “genus ingenuum” and the “genus
libertinum.” “Causis” applies to those conditions of the libertini, such as the possession
of children of a definite age, which might serve as a ground for enrolment
in a rural tribe; and “quaestibus” refers to the distinction between landowners and
the “opifices et sellularii” of the city. “They changed the arrangement for voting,
and drew up the tribal lists on a local basis according to the social orders, the conditions,
and the callings of men;” cf. Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i> ii. 265 f.; p. 354 f. below.
Among the many objections to Smith’s theory these two may be mentioned: if the
classes were introduced at this late historical time, (1) they would not have been
ascribed to Servius Tullius; (2) they would have been adapted to the economic
conditions of the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, whereas in 179 they were largely outgrown by
the depreciation of the standard of value, the increase in the cost of living, and
the growth of enormous estates. The <i>Römische Timokratie</i> is ably written, but its
main thesis—the institution of the classes in the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>—remains
unproved.</p>

estates of seven and fourteen iugera. But it is difficult to work out a consistent

view in any form, as he doubts the existence of the Servian classes. In general he
has greatly exaggerated the difficulties of their administration.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_507" href="#FNanchor_507" class="label">[507]</a> As silver is at present worth 51¼ cents an ounce (so quoted in New York,
Sept. 5, 1908), a denarius (= ⅟₇₂ lb. Troy) of the coinage preceding 217 is worth by
weight today 8½ cents. A more just comparison would be based on the present
coined values. As a dollar contains 371¼ grains of silver, a denarius would be worth
21½ cents; or with a liberal allowance for the alloy, we might say about 20 cents.
The sesterce, ¼ denarius, would therefore be equivalent to five cents. An estate of
100,000 asses of heavy weight (sesterces) would be worth about $5000, of the sextantarian
standard $2000. It is hardly possible that so large a proportion of the
population as was contained in the first class should average the former amount of
wealth to the family. In fact the purchasing power of money was enormously higher
than these equivalents indicate. In 430 the value of an ox or cow was legally set at
100 libral asses and of a sheep at ten. Reckoning a beef at the low modern value
of $45, and a sheep at $4.50, we obtain a value of 45 cents for the libral <i>as</i>, or 22½
cents for one of 5 oz. weight (sesterce), which would give the denarius a purchasing
power of 90 cents.</p>

were considered equivalent to a denarius or a drachma, which would give a rating
of 160,000 asses for those who wore the cuirass. But the military pay was still reckoned
at ten asses to the denarius (Pliny, <i>N. H.</i> xxxiii. 3. 45); the censors seem to
have used the same ratio (Livy xxxix. 44. 2 f. compared with Plut. <i>Cat. Mai.</i> 18);
and it is therefore highly probable that in this statement Polybius intended to express
in drachmas the value of 100,000 asses. Taken in its entirety, the passage
sufficiently proves that reference is to the highest class; the majority (οἱ πολλοί)
of soldiers, he says, have breastplates, but those rated above 10,000 drachmas wear
cuirasses. If, as Belot, <i>Rév. écon. et mon.</i> 77 ff., imagines, the sum of 100,000 asses
fell below the rating of the lowest class, there would hardly have been a soldier without
the cuirass.</p>

of the subject is compatible with the view that the knights were then patrician—a
view however which these writers did not have clearly in mind. Livy’s
statement (iii. 27. 1) that a certain patrician served in the infantry because of his
poverty harmonizes well with the same view; for as the aes equestre and hordearium
were not yet introduced, a poor patrician would be unable to own and keep a
horse. Those scholars therefore seem to be wrong who, like Grathewohl, ibid. 67,

quilubet.” As in the time of Cicero auspices had come to be a mere pretence
(p. 118), an attendant without skill or scruple would best serve the magistrate’s
purpose. In Livy iv. 18. 6, the augurs see the omen for the dictator, but some
other attendant might serve the purpose. Being a paid functionary, the bird-seer
mentioned by Dion. Hal. ii. 6. 2 as assisting in an auspication could not have
been a public augur; Valeton, in <i>Mnemos.</i> xviii. 406 ff.; Wissowa, <i>Relig. u.
Kult. d. Römer</i>, 456, n. 8. The magistrate requested assistance in the following
form: “Q. Fabi, te mihi in auspicio esse volo;” and the reply was “Audivi;” Cic.
<i>Div.</i> ii. 34. 71; cf. § 72. From this formula it appears that the person summoned
did not hold, but assisted in, the auspices; Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i> i. 338. The auspices
are always said to belong not to the augurs, but to the magistrates; Cic. <i>Leg.</i>
iii. 3. 10; Messala, in Gell. xiii. 15. 4. Instead of remaining with the augurs in
the city the auspices followed a duly elected consul into the field; Livy xxii. 1. 6.
Auspicari is strictly a function of the magistrate (cf. Varro, <i>Rer. hum.</i> xx, in
Non. Marc. 92) though the word is sometimes applied to the observation made
by augurs (Fest. ep. 18), whose function is properly termed augurium, augurare;

<p><a id="Footnote_719" href="#FNanchor_719" class="label">[719]</a> A closely related question is whether concilium is ever restricted to the deliberative
stage of a session preliminary to the division into voting units, with comitia
limited in a corresponding manner to the final, voting stage of the session. A few
passages, as examples (2) and (4), might be explained by such a conjecture, but
others, as Livy iii. 13. 9 (“Virginio comitia habente conlegae appellati dimisere concilium”)
prove the supposition impossible. Concilium denotes the assembly in its
final as well as in its initial stage, voting as well as deliberating, whereas in ordinary
political language contio is used to denote the merely listening or witnessing assembly,
whether organized or unorganized, whether called to prepare the citizens for
voting or for any other purpose.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_744" href="#FNanchor_744" class="label">[744]</a> The classification of comitial functions into elective, legislative, and judicial
follows Cicero, <i>Div.</i> ii. 35. 74: “Ut comitiorum vel in iudiciis populi vel in iure
legum vel in creandis magistratibus.” In this volume, accordingly, “legislative”
refers not merely to law-making in the narrower sense, but also to the passing of
resolutions on all affairs, domestic and foreign, including necessarily the lex de bello
indicendo.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_746" href="#FNanchor_746" class="label">[746]</a> Only one instance of concilium as an elective body has been found; <i>Lex Iulia
Municipalis</i>, in <i>CIL.</i> i. 206. 132: the election of magistrates “comitieis conciliove.”
The explanation is that the usage of some of the Italian municipia differed from
the Roman, and the author of the law had to adapt his language to local custom.
With this exception the inscriptions are in line with the literature.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_752" href="#FNanchor_752" class="label">[752]</a> Fest. ep. 38: “Concilium dicitur a concalando, id est vocando.” It is accepted
by Curtius, <i>Griech. Etym.</i> 139; Vaniček, <i>Griech.-lat. etym. Wörterb.</i> 143; Walde, <i>Lat.
etym. Wörterb.</i> 136. But Corssen, <i>Beitr. z. ital. Sprachk.</i> 41 f., rejects this etymology
on the ground that it does not harmonize with all the meanings of the word and of
its derivative “conciliare”; also Gudeman, in <i>Thes. ling. lat.</i> iv. 44. Corssen, analyzing
it into con-cil-iu-m, and connecting -cil- with a root kal-, “to cover,” supposes
the original meaning to be simply “a joining together,” “a union,”—giving that
signification which he considers primary. It is equally reasonable, however, to assume
the development to be (1) “a calling together,” (2) “a meeting for consultation,”
(3) “a natural union of individuals of any kind.” In the third sense it is applied
perhaps figuratively to inanimate things, especially the union of atoms to form
objects, by Lucretius i. 183, 484, 772, 1082; ii. 120; iii. 805; cf. Ovid, <i>Met.</i> i. 710.</p>

crowd; <i>Diff.</i> ed. Beck, p. 47. 43: “Concilium est convocata multitudo, conventus
ex diversis locis populum in unum contrahit, coetus fortuitu congregatur.” The
ancients understood this to be the meaning of the word; Varro <i>L. L.</i> vi. 43: “A
cogitatione concilium, inde consilium,” an unsuccessful though instructive guess;
Fest. ep. 38: “Concilium dicitur a populo consensu;” Isid. <i>Etym.</i> vi. 16. 12:
“Concilium a communi intentione ductum, quasi communicilium.” This interpretation
is supported by several glosses; φιλοποιεία (<i>Corp. Gloss. Lat.</i> ii. 471. 49),
συμβούλιον (ibid. ii. 107. 5), coenobulium, caenobulium (ibid. iv. 321. 27). Lastly
our derivative “council” points in the same direction. The meaning “deliberative
assembly” has been accepted by Gudeman, in <i>Thes. ling. lat.</i> iv. 46, who has added
citations from the whole range of Latin literature.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_763" href="#FNanchor_763" class="label">[763]</a> Thus is explained a phenomenon for which Mommsen could find no adequate
reason—that the so-called “patricio-plebeian” tribal assembly was more apt to be
called concilium than were the comitia centuriata. The deliberative feature of the
concilium also explains the close approach of the word to contio—another fact
which Mommsen knew but did not understand.</p>

luci nundinis.” Another illustration is the statement of Gellius, xv. 27. 3, that wills
were made in comitia calata, in a contio of the people. Mommsen’s assumption
(<i>Röm. Staatsr.</i> i. 199 and n. 3) that no contio was held on a market day as a rule,
to which there were exceptions, is altogether unsatisfactory. The passages cited refer
to a law, not to a mere custom to be observed or not at the will of the magistrate.
The contio which met on a market day must have been essentially different in nature
from the contio which was forbidden for market days; cf. also Varro, <i>L. L.</i> vi. 93;
Cic. <i>Rab. Perd.</i> 4. 11.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_771" href="#FNanchor_771" class="label">[771]</a> The calata comitia curiata is termed contio by Gell. xv. 27. 3: “Quod calatis
comitiis in populi contione fieret.” Cicero, <i>Rab. Perd.</i> 4. 11 (cf. 5. 15) speaks of
the witnessing comitia centuriata as contio, and the lustral centuriate assembly was
similarly termed; <i>Censoriae Tabulae</i>, in Varro, <i>L. L.</i> vi. 87: “Conventionem habet
qui lustrum conditurus est.” A widespread idea (held by Karlowa, <i>Röm. Rechtsgesch.</i>
i. 379; Liebenam, in Pauly-Wissowa, <i>Real-Encycl.</i> iv. 1149; Soltau, <i>Altröm.

(<i>Röm. Staatsr.</i> ii. 313, n. 2), that the tribunes could not summon the consuls but
could compel them to speak when present, is not altogether satisfactory. The comment
of Gellius (§ 7 f.: “Huius ego iuris, quod M. Varro tradit, Labeonem arbitror
vana tunc fiducia, cum privatus esset, vocatum a tribunis non isse. Quae, malum,
autem ratio fuit vocantibus nolle obsequi, quos confiteare ius habere prendendi?
Nam qui iure prendi potest, et in vincula duci potest”) supports the view given above
in the text. A magistracy might afford some degree of protection, but on the principle
enunciated by Gellius the tribune, who had the power to arrest a consul, was
in a position practically to compel him to appear at a public meeting. As further
examples of the president’s power to force speaking, Cato, a tribune of the plebs,
compelled the keepers of the Sibylline books to come before the people in contio

the tribunes. The word used in these passages to designate the removal of the

pontiff for the election of plebeian tribunes after the fall of the decemvirate (Cic.

calantur eius mensis nonae a pontificibus, quintanae an septimanae sint futurae in
Capitolio in curia Calabra”; <i>Hemerol. Praenest.</i> Ian. 1, in <i>CIL.</i> i.² p. 231: “Hae et
(aliae pri) mae calendae appellantur, quia (eorum pri) mus is dies est quos pont(i)fex
minor quo(vis anni) mense ad nonas sin(gulas currere edicit in capi)tolio in curia
cala(bra)”; Macrob. <i>Sat.</i> i. 15. 9 f.: “Pontifici minori haec provincia delegabatur,
ut novae lunae primum observaret aspectum visamque regi sacrificulo nuntiaret.
Itaque sacrificio a rege et minore pontifice celebrato idem pontifex calata, id est
vocata in Capitolium plebe iuxta curiam Calabram ... quot numero dies a Kalendis
ad Nonas superessent pronuntiabat.” Serv. <i>in Aen.</i> viii. 654 and Plut. <i>Q. R.</i> 24 are
inexact, and still more confused is Lyd. <i>Mens.</i> iii. 7; cf. Mommsen, <i>Röm. Staatsr.</i>
ii. 39, n. 1. In the opinion of Mommsen the announcement on the calends was not
to an assembly, but was merely preparatory to the assembly on the nones; but the
words of Macrobius (vocata ... plebe) clearly indicate a gathering of the people on
that day.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_872" href="#FNanchor_872" class="label">[872]</a> Varro, <i>L. L.</i> vi. 13, 28; Macrob. <i>Sat.</i> i. 15. 12; cf. Herzog, <i>Röm. Staatsverf.</i> i.
109 and n. 1. Mommsen, <i>Röm. Staatsr.</i> ii. 40, n. 2, warns us against confusing “this
unorganized contio” with the comitia calata, which are always organized in curiae or
in centuries. Labeo, in Gell. xv. 27. 1, states, however, that calata comitia were held
for the inauguration of the king and priests. If for this occasion the purely passive
assembly was organized in voting divisions, there can be no reason for doubting that
it was organized also on the occasion in question, when it met in the assembly-place
of the calata comitia—a place which could not be opened sine calatione—and its
convocation was designated by “calare” not “vocare.” It is significant that the
phrase “calata contio” is never used. Mommsen gives no authority or reason for
his assumption; cf. Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i> i. 398; Herzog, <i>Röm. Staatsverf.</i> i. 111;
Marquardt, <i>Röm. Staatsv.</i> iii. 283, 323; Wissowa, <i>Relig. u. Kult. d. Römer</i>, 440, for
the view here maintained that the assembly for hearing the calendar was calata.</p>

to the detestatio sacrorum warrants the conclusion that it, too, was taken in the

for the reason given in n. 8 below.</p>

that Herennius was proposing to bring the question not before the centuries, as
Drumann-Gröbe, <i>Gesch. Roms</i>, ii. 188, n. 3, imagines, for a tribune had no means of
doing so, but before the thirty-five tribes, who were the universus populus (Cic. <i>Leg.

<p><a id="Footnote_939" href="#FNanchor_939" class="label">[939]</a> The falsification of pedigrees by plebeian families to prove descent from
patrician ancestors of the same name is sufficient evidence that the name was
retained through the transition; cf. Lange, <i>Kleine Schriften</i>, ii. 7 f. Were not the
sacra retained, the transition of an entire gens would mean the destruction of its old
religion and the creation of a new one—which is impossible. For this reason it

adoptarit”; 13. 35: “Tu (Clodi) neque Fonteius es, qui esse debebas, neque patris
heres neque amissis sacris paternis in haec adoptiva venisti.” In <i>Har. Resp.</i> 27. 57
(“Iste parentum nomen, sacra, memoriam, gentem Fonteiano nomine obruit”)
Cicero does not say that Clodius assumed the gentile name of Fonteius, but rather
that he used this name as a means of destroying the name, sacra, etc. of his parents;
and in fact he continued to be called Clodius; cf. Dio Cass. xxxix. 23. 2 (official use).
He claimed still to belong to the Clodian gens rather than to the Fonteian (Cic.
<i>Dom.</i> 44. 116), whereas Cicero, looking upon the emancipation as a sham, insists
that he was a Fonteian.</p>

confusion into the case by representing Clodius as having given up his native religion
without receiving that of Fonteius, as being a gentilis of the Claudii though he had

<p><a id="Footnote_947" href="#FNanchor_947" class="label">[947]</a> This double act is most clearly stated by Livy iv. 4. 7: “Nobilitatem istam

ὁ δῆμος εἴς τε τοὺς πατρικίους αὐτὸν (Appius Claudius) ἐνέγραψε. This passage
shows that Dionysius regards the process as an act of the people and of the senate,
though he does not speak of the latter as coöptation. In the case of Appius Claudius
Livy, ii. 16. 5, says simply that he was enrolled among the patres (“inter patres
lectus”), and in like manner Suetonius, <i>Tib.</i> i, states that the patrician gens Claudia
was coöpted into the class of patrician gentes.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_961" href="#FNanchor_961" class="label">[961]</a> Mommsen’s theory (<i>Röm. Staatsr.</i> iii. 29 and n. 2) that the patriciate was conferred
through the coöperation of the king and the comitia appears accordingly to rest
on a weak foundation. He gives no evidence, but bases his contention on the argument
(1) that the community was sovereign, (2) that—the patriciate being in his opinion
equivalent to the citizenship and the comitia curiata being a group of gentes—the
downfall of the comitia made the reception of gentes impossible. Ground is taken
against the theory of popular sovereignty in the following chapter. Against his
second point it can be urged that the original comitia were neither patrician nor
“gentile”; hence there is no occasion for speaking of the downfall of such comitia or
of its sweeping consequences.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1092" href="#FNanchor_1092" class="label">[1092]</a> The formula for the curiate law is unknown. Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i> i. 307 ff. 407 f.,
459, 461 f., supposes that it not only pledged the people to obedience, but also
defined the imperium and bound the king not to exceed the limitations imposed;
that every constitutional modification of the imperium required a corresponding
modification of the curiate act. Herzog, <i>Röm. Staatsverf.</i> i. 111 f., further assumes
that the law contained the formula of treaty on which in his opinion the state rested,
and that before the age of written documents this treaty was handed down orally
through the repetition of the law. Lange’s theory, which runs throughout his great
work, seems to rest on the single statement of Tacitus, <i>Ann.</i> xi. 22: “Quaestores
regibus etiam tum imperantibus instituti sunt, quod lex curiata ostendit a L. Bruto
repetita.” But this statement proves only that the quaestors were mentioned in the
curiate law, and this circumstance is otherwise explained below, p. 189. That the
law defined and limited the imperium is unlikely (1) because in early time, when
the act had a real meaning, precise definitions were unknown; (2) because there is
no evidence for it.</p>

<p>P. Servilius Rullus stated, evidently in his rogation, that the object of the curiate act
to be passed for the decemviri provided for in his bill was “ut ii decemviratum
habeant, quos plebs designaverit” (Cic. <i>Leg. Agr.</i> ii. 10. 26)—a formula probably
copied from earlier laws. From this statement and from evidence furnished below
(p. 185 f.) it is practically certain that the formula for the curiate act ran somewhat
like that for an election.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1093" href="#FNanchor_1093" class="label">[1093]</a> It is true that Cicero (p. 183, n. 2) supposes the king to have been elected by
the curiate assembly, and the imperium to have been afterward sanctioned by the
same assembly. This double vote of the curiae seems as improbable as it was unnecessary.
We may reasonably consider the alleged first vote a mistaken inference
from the later election of higher magistrates by the centuries. The assumption of
an acclamation as the first stage in the process accords far better with primitive
conditions.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1114" href="#FNanchor_1114" class="label">[1114]</a> Magistratus optuma lege is the same as magistratus iustus; cf. Messala, p. 185,
n. 6. In this connection iustus does not signify legal as opposed to illegal, but
legally or technically perfect, correct; cf. for the meaning “proper,” “perfect,” Cic.
<i>Fam.</i> ii. 10. 3 (iusta victoria); Caes. <i>B. G.</i> i. 23 (iustum iter); Livy i. 4. 4 (iusti cursum
amnis); xxxix. 2. 8 (iusto proelio). When Cicero (<i>Red. in Sen.</i> 11. 27),
accordingly, speaks of the comitia centuriata as the iusta comitia, he does not imply
that the other comitia and their acts lack legality, but rather that they carry less
weight; and when as late as 300 the patricians claimed that they alone had iustum
imperium et auspicium (Livy x. 8. 9), they could only mean that their right to these
powers was better established than that of the plebeians. C. Flaminius, consul in
217, possessed imperium, which he was actually exercising over his troops, but which
was not iustum, for he had neglected the auspical formalities appropriate to the
entrance upon the consulship (Livy xxii. 1. 5). It would be wrong, however, to
suppose with Nissen, <i>Beitr. z. röm. Staatsr.</i> 51, that he commanded on the sufferance
only of his soldiers.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1116" href="#FNanchor_1116" class="label">[1116]</a> The usual expression is “de suo imperio curiatam legem tulit,” or “populum
consuluit;” Cic. <i>Rep.</i> ii. 13. 25; 17. 31; 18. 33; 20. 35; 21. 38; Livy ix. 38. 15.
According to Cicero, <i>Phil.</i> v. 16. 45, the senate grants the imperium to Octavianus,
a private citizen. The interrex, who could not have had a curiate law, nevertheless
possessed imperium (Livy i. 17. 5 f.), and the absolute imperium was granted by a
decree of the senate (Livy iii. 4. 9; Sall. <i>Cat.</i> 29; <i>Hist.</i> i. 77. 22). See also Cic.
<i>Leg.</i> iii. 3. 9: “Imperia, potestates, legationes, quom senatus creverit populusve
iusserit, ex urbe exeunto;” <i>Leg. Agr.</i> ii. 7. 17: “Omnes potestates, imperia, curationes
ab universo populo proficisci convenit” (reference cannot here be to the
curiate assembly, which in this connection Cicero does not recognize as the people).
For the centuriate assembly, see Livy xxvi. 18. 9: “Omnes non centuriae modo sed
etiam homines P. Scipioni imperium esse in Hispania iusserunt;” 22. 15: “Centuriam
vero iuniorum seniores consulere voluisse, quibus imperium suffragio mandarunt.”
For the tribal assembly, see T. Annius Luscus, <i>Orat. adv. Ti. Gracch.</i> in Fest. 314.
30: “Imperium quod plebes ... dederat.” It is a fact, too, that the tribal assembly
had power to abrogate the imperium; Livy xxvii. 20. 11; 21. 1, 4; xxix. 19. 6; cf.
p. 342, 360, 367. Also from Cic. <i>Leg. Agr.</i> ii. 11. 28 (“Vidit ... sine curiata lege
decemviros potestatem habere non posse, quoniam per novem tribus essent constituti”)
we must infer that had these decemvirs been elected in the regular way, by
the thirty-five tribes, they would have had the potestas without a curiate law. The
phrase nullis comitiis in 11. 29 (“Si hoc fieri potest, ut ... quisquam nullis comitiis
imperium aut potestatem adsequi posset, etc.,”) implies that the imperium or potestas
may be obtained in more than one form of comitia—either the centuriata or the
tributa. In the same paragraph he asserts that on the principle followed by Servilius,
whom he is assailing, any one could obtain the imperium or potestas without the vote
of any comitia, for he does not consider the comitia curiata real comitia, seeing that
they have degenerated into a mere form. From these passages it is clear that Cicero
believed the imperium or potestas to be conferred by the centuries or tribes and
merely confirmed by the curiae.</p>

Dion. Hal. ii. 62. 1 ascribes the introduction of the lictors to Tarquin the

as a mere sanction, but rather as a legislative act which called the lictors into being;

asserts, was the fact that they were absent from Rome at the opening of their
official year. But the truth is that they were both present (Livy xxiv. 10 f.), and had
accordingly no occasion for establishing such precedent on their own responsibility.

used this assembly for elections, legislation, and declarations of war, that Tarquin the
Proud set aside the Servian arrangement (iv. 43. 1), which was restored at the beginning
of the republic. The first of these ideas is an inference from republican
usage, not based on knowledge of any definite act of the assembly in the regal period.

<p><a id="Footnote_1184" href="#FNanchor_1184" class="label">[1184]</a> An objection to the view represented by Soltau, ibid. 270-5, that the coöperation
of the army in the overthrow of Tarquin the Proud caused its immediate transformation
into the comitia centuriata, is that we have no ground for accepting as historical
the details of the overthrow to which he calls attention. In p. 285-96 he attempts
to reconstruct the earliest constitution of the republic on the theory that the army
elected the consuls (283), that for a time those who were not actually on military
duty were excluded from a vote in the centuriate assembly. The sources give no information
regarding such an assembly, and we have no right to assume it, at least as
a regular, recognized institution, for any period however early. Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i>
i. 465, supposes that with the founding of the republic the assembly began to diverge
from the army, the two institutions having previously been identical; cf. Guiraud, in

rarenter flamen Dialis creatus consul est, cum bella consulibus mandabantur.”
There was no objection to this flamen’s seeing the comitia centuriata, but the armed
centuries it was not lawful for him to see. Cf. Varro, <i>L. L.</i> vi. 93: “Alia de causa
hic magistrates (quaestor) non potest exercitum urbanum convocare; censor, consul,
dictator, interrex potest, quod censor exercitum centuriato constituit quinquennalem,

sometimes denotes the body of men enlisted for military service from those who were

cf. p. 66 f., 77; see also table on p. 210. A great difference exists between
Livy and Dionysius, on the one hand, and Cicero, on the other, as to the number of
centuries in the highest class. Cicero (<i>Rep.</i> ii. 22. 39: “Nunc rationem videtis
esse talem, ut equitum centuriae cum sex suffragiis et prima classis addita centuria,
quae ad summum usum urbis fabris tignariis est data, LXXXVIIII centurias habebat”)
states that the eighteen centuries of knights, the centuries of the first class,
and one century of mechanics amounted to eighty-nine, which would give but seventy
to the first class. The most satisfactory explanation of this difficulty seems to be that
Cicero, while professing to describe the earlier centuriate system, had in mind a
formative stage of the new organization, in which the first class comprised seventy
centuries; p. 67, 215, n. 2. On the number in the fifth class, see p. 66, 77, 208.</p>

Cicero, <i>Rep.</i> ii. 22. 39; <i>Orat.</i> 46. 156, mentions only the century of carpenters.
Placing this century with the first class, he either overlooks that of the smiths or
wishes to reckon it with the second class (cf. Huschke, <i>Verf. des Serv.</i> 153). As
he reckons the total number of centuries at one hundred and ninety-three, he has
allowed for both.</p>

creant ... omnesque deinceps ex collegio eiusdem anni refici apparebat.... Qui
priusquam renuntiarentur iure vocatis tribubus.... Calvus ita verba fecit.” We
might amend this evidently corrupt passage either by changing praerogativa to the
plural, as do Müller (2d ed. 1888) and Weissenborn (8th ed. 1885), thus making it
refer to the equestrian centuriae. At the same time we might read iis revocatis
(scil. praerogativis). The passage would then apply to the Servian arrangement.
Or we could bring it to the support of the reformed order by reading creat (cf.
Madvig). The preferable interpretation of the qui priusquam ... tribubus clause
seems to be “Before they could be declared elected on the official reports from the
tribes,” the official reports being counted tribe by tribe, as will hereafter appear;
p. 225. See also on this passage, Plüss, <i>Centurienverf.</i> 10 ff.; Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i> ii.

many generations, carefully preserved by the Romans, it has assumed in our time a
more democratic character, driven into this new course by certain powerful forces.
The centuries were not abolished, but the decision of their votes has lost its former
carefulness—or we may read, the calling of the centuries no longer retains its
precise order. This fact, he tells us, he himself often noticed when present at

<p><a id="Footnote_1282" href="#FNanchor_1282" class="label">[1282]</a> The citations below refer to a plurality of classes for the period following the
reform, without mentioning a definite number; Sall. <i>Iug.</i> 86; Cic. <i>Rep.</i> iv. 2. 2;
<i>Flacc.</i> 7. 15; <i>Red. ad Quir.</i> 7. 17; Symmachus, <i>Pro Patre</i>, 7 (Seeck); Auson.
<i>Grat. Act.</i> iii. 13; ix. 44 (Peiper); p. 287, 293 (Bip.). In his speech for the
Voconian law, 169, the elder Cato, in Gell. vi. 13. 3, referred to the distinction between
the classici and those who were infra classem, from which we may conclude
that the distinction existed in his time. The agrarian law of 111 (<i>CIL.</i> i. 200. 37)
mentions the first class; also Livy xliii. 16. 14. The first and second are spoken of
by Cic. <i>Phil.</i> ii. 33. 82. Ullrich’s view (<i>Centuriatcom.</i>), resting on these passages,
is that there were but two classes, one of seniors another of juniors. Besides involving
many impossibilities, it is refuted by the frequent references to the continuance
of the census as an element in the system (see note below) and by the occasional
mention of the five classes. The latter number for the time of C. Gracchus is given
by Pseud. Sall. <i>Rep. Ord.</i> 2. 8. This work, though late, is generally considered good
authority; cf. Greenidge, <i>Hist. of Rome</i>, i. 237 f. Five are mentioned also by Gell.
vi (vii). 13. 1; Serv. <i>in Aen.</i> vii. 716; Arnob. <i>Adv. Nat.</i> ii. 67, with no definite
reference to a particular period. Cicero’s allusion (<i>Acad. Pr.</i> ii. 23. 73) to the fifth
class implies at least that the five classes were then fresh in the memory. The
mention of an amplissimus census for the time of Cicero by Ascon. <i>in Pis.</i> 16, proves
the existence of more than two classes at the time. These citations, together with
the fact that no other definite number but five is ever spoken of by the ancient
writers, must lead to the conclusion that there was no change.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1283" href="#FNanchor_1283" class="label">[1283]</a> To the time of Marius the soldiers were still drawn from the census classes;
Polyb. vi. 19. 2; Sall. <i>Iug.</i> 86. The first class was distinguished from the rest by
its armor, Polyb. vi. 23. 15. That the political classes likewise rested on the census
is proved by Cic. <i>Leg.</i> iii. 3. 7; 19. 44; Gell. vi (vii). 13; xv. 27. 5; Ascon. <i>in Pis.</i>
16. The agrarian law of 111 (<i>CIL.</i> i. 200. 37) implies a property qualification of
the class mentioned (note above). These citations dispose of the hypothesis of Plüss,
<i>Centurienverf.</i> 36 ff., 80, which represents the classes of this period as consisting of
groups of tribes resting partly on the census but mainly on differences of rank.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1291" href="#FNanchor_1291" class="label">[1291]</a> Voting or the announcement of the votes according to tribes is indicated by
Polyb. vi. 14. 7: Τοῖς γὰρ θανάτου κρινομένοις, ἐπὰν καταδικάζωνται δίδωσι τὴν
ἐξουσίαν τὸ παρ’ αὐτοῖς ἔθος ἀπαλλάττεσθαι φανερῶς, κἂν ἔτι μία λείπηται φυλὴ τῶν
ἐπικυρουσῶν τὴν κρίσιν ἀψηφόρητος, ἑκούσιον ἑαυτοῦ κατγνόντα φυγαδείαν. (To those
who are on trial for life, while the vote of condemnation is being taken, even if a
single tribe of those whose suffrages are needed to ratify the sentence has not voted,
the Roman custom grants permission to depart openly, condemning themselves to
voluntary exile.) This procedure must have been in the comitia centuriata, and
hence the votes of the centuries must have been taken or announced by tribes;
cf. Klebs, in <i>Zeitschr. d. Savignyst.</i> xii (1892). 220; Plüss, <i>Centurienverf.</i> 14. See
also Cic. <i>Leg. Agr.</i> ii. 2. 4: “Meis comitiis non tabellam vindicem tacitae libertatis,
sed vocem [unam] prae vobis indicem vestrarum erga me voluntatum ac studiorum
tulistis. Itaque me non extrema tribus (not diribitio) suffragiorum, sed primi illi
vestri concursus, neque singulae voces praeconum, sed una vox universi populi Romani
consulem declaravit.” The MSS. have tribus and there is nothing against it,
though Müller, following Richter, has adopted diribitio for the Teubner text, 1896.
The meaning is “In my election you offered not merely the ballot, the vindication
of your silent liberty, but also your unanimous voice as evidence of your good will
to me and of your eagerness in my behalf. Hence it was not the last tribal group
of votes but your first coming together, not the single announcements of the criers
but the unanimous voice of the entire Roman people which declared me consul.”
From this passage we may infer (1) that the votes were cast or announced by tribes,
(2) that the tribe cast more than one vote, (3) that the result was sometimes known
before the last tribe was reached. Cf. further Cic. <i>Phil.</i> vi. 5. 12; 6. 16; xi. 8. 18;
Livy v. 18. 2; vi. 21. 5; viii. 37. 12; xxix. 37. 13; ep. xlix; Oros. v. 7. 1; Lucan,
<i>Phars.</i> v. 391 ff.; Plut. <i>Cat. Min.</i> 42.</p>

Pseudacr. Schol. Cruq. ad Hor. <i>Poet.</i> 341: “Singulae tribus certas habebant centurias
seniorum et iuniorum”; Livy i. 43. 12 f. implies that the number of centuries
was a multiple of the number of tribes, in other words that the century was an
integral part of the tribe; cf. Q. Cic. <i>Petit.</i> 5. 17 f.; 8. 32; Mommsen, <i>Röm. Trib.</i> 74.
The most convincing evidence is that of inscriptions of the imperial period (p. 220)
which prove the urban tribes to have comprised each an integral number of centuries.
Mommsen, <i>Röm. Staatsr.</i> iii. 274, has therefore failed in his attempt to limit to the
first class the division of the tribes into centuries.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1295" href="#FNanchor_1295" class="label">[1295]</a> Niebuhr, ibid. His authorities for the two classes are Livy xliii. 16. 14: “Cum
ex duodecim centuriis equitum octo censorem condemnassent multaeque aliae primae
classis”; Cic. <i>Phil.</i> ii. 33. 82: “Prima classis vocatur, renuntiatur; deinde, ita ut
adsolet, suffragia; tum secunda classis vocatur; quae omnia sunt citius facta, quam
dixi. Confecto negotio bonus augur ... alio die inquit”; cf. p. 113. In the
Livian citation, however, the mention of only the first class affords no hint as to the
number of classes to follow; and the keen analysis of the Ciceronian passage made
by Huschke, <i>Verf. des Serv.</i> 615 and n. 8, proves confecto negotio to signify not
necessarily that the voting had been finished, but rather that the comitia had advanced
so far as to preclude the obnuntiatio. It should be served before the assembly
convened, not after the meeting began (“Non comitiis habitis, sed priusquam habeantur”;
§ 81). Confecto negotio, equivalent to comitiis habitis, is the negative of
priusquam habeantur. This interpretation deprives the theory of two classes, held
by Niebuhr, Ullrich, and others, of its only support.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1318" href="#FNanchor_1318" class="label">[1318]</a> In the clause “Ut equitum centuriae cum sex suffrages et prima classis addita
centuria, quae ... data, LXXXVIIII centuriae habeat,” centuriae applies to the
centuries proper, but in the clause immediately following, “Quibus ex centum quattuor
centuriis (tot enim reliquae sunt) octo solae accesserunt,” the word on Mommsen’s
supposition must denote not the centuries themselves but the voting groups of
centuries. Though Mommsen usually avoids the application of the term century to
the assumed voting units, he allows himself to do so on p. 274 and in n. 2. Granting
that in this instance he has used the word correctly, we should have the first class
composed of simple centuries and the others of centuries which were themselves
composed of centuries—an evidently absurd result of his assumption.</p>

Tellier’s supposition (<i>Organ. cent.</i> 88, n. 1) that the four classes may have differed
in number of votes (for example, 30, 28, 28, 14), and that the several voting groups
of a class comprised the same number of centuries, in some cases with a fraction of a
century, e.g., 2, 2½, 2½, 5 centuries for the four classes respectively. This combination
would be as undemocratic and as impracticable as any of those proposed by Klebs.</p>

cf. Cic. <i>Phil.</i> ii. 33. 82. Lange too hastily rejects the evidence of these two passages.
The vote of each century was announced separately; Varro, <i>L. L.</i> vii.

these two passages are concerned, Lange could be right; but his view is contradicted
by Festus 334. 29 (“Sex suffragia appellantur in equitum centuriis, quae sunt
adiecta—MS. adfectae—ei numero centuriarum, quas Priscus Tarquinius rex

multaeque aliae primae classis” (171 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). This passage proves that the
announcement distinguished the votes of the twelve equestrian centuries both from
the sex suffragia and from those of the class. Cic. <i>Phil.</i> ii. 33. 82: “Sortitio praerogativae;
quiescit. Renuntiatur; tacet. Prima classis vocatur, renuntiatur; deinde,
ita ut adsolet, suffragia; tum secunda classis vocatur.” Here Cicero informs us that
the (sex) suffragia were announced after the report of the first class had been given.
The circumstance that he does not mention the separate calling of the suffragia indicates
that their separation from the first class was limited to the announcement.
There is no reason why the Romans should have added to the length of the centuriate
sessions by assigning a part of the day to the exclusive use of these six centuries.
Livy, i. 43. 8 f., has their inferiority in mind. It is unnecessary to amend the Ciceronian
passage. The attempt of Holzapfel, in <i>Beiträge zur alten Gesch.</i> i (1902).
254 f., is unsuccessful. Klebs, in <i>Zeitschr. d. Savignyst.</i> xii (1892). 237 ff., fruitlessly
opposes the division of the equites into these two groups.</p>

viewing as historical the so-called lex Valeria de candidatis, assigned to the first year
of the republic (Plut. <i>Popl.</i> 11; Lange, ibid. ii. 532), which ordered the presiding
magistrate to accept as candidates all qualified patricians who offered themselves for
the consulship—a principle said to have been afterward applied to other patrician

not have thus been forced; hence more probably lex in these phrases is not a
comitial act but the formula of appointment; Greenidge, <i>Leg. Proced.</i> 356 and n. 1.

quod aerata ostia haberet in domo.” According to Livy v. 23. 11; 32. 8 f., it was
misappropriation of the Veientan spoil. Diodorus, xiv. 117. 6, states that according
to one report the accusation was that he had driven white horses in his triumph.
The appeal was to the comitia centuriata; Cic. <i>Dom.</i> 32. 86. This case indicates
either inconsistency in legal usage, quite possible in early time, or more probably the
union of inconsistent traditions. The facts that Pliny mentions a quaestor apparently
as prosecutor, not simply as witness (Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i> ii. 582), and that Cicero
represents the trial as belonging to the centuries suffice to indicate a questorian
prosecution before that assembly. Should we venture to bring consistency to so
uncertain a story, we could suppose that in his absence, the tribunes, taking up the
case, lightened the penalty to a fine.</p>

against C. Popillius Laenas, 107, on the ground of a disgraceful surrender to the
Tigurini. It was on this occasion that the ballot was first used in a trial for perduellio.
The accused seems to have been condemned to exile; Cic. <i>Leg.</i> iii. 16. 36;
<i>Herenn.</i> i. 15. 25; iv. 24. 34; Oros. v. 15. 24. This case, which resembles those
of far earlier time, has nothing to do with violation of the right of appeal; (Cic.)
<i>Herenn.</i> ibid.—(2) Similar in this respect was the prosecution of Q. Fabius Maximus
Servilianus for the murder of his son. The accused went into exile before judgment
was pronounced; Oros. v. 16. 8; Val. Max. vi. 1. 5.—(3) More famous is the
prosecution of Q. Caecilius Metellus Numidicus, 100, by L. Appuleius Saturninus
because the former refused to swear to maintain the agrarian law of the latter.
Technically the charge was that Metellus refused to do his duty as a senator. The
accused withdrew into exile before the trial, whereupon, by vote of the assembly, he
was interdicted from fire and water; Livy, ep. lxix.; Appian, <i>B. C.</i> i. 31. 137-40;
Cic. <i>Dom.</i> 31. 82; <i>Sest.</i> 16. 37; 47. 101.—(4) Decianus, tribune of the plebs, 97, in
accusing P. Furius, tribune of the preceding year, let fall some complaint regarding
the murder of Saturninus, and on that ground was accused, probably by a tribune of
the plebs, and condemned to exile; Cic. <i>Rab. Perd.</i> 9. 24; Schol. Bob. 230.—(5)
The prosecution of M. Aemilius Scaurus for maiestas by Q. Varius, tribune,
Dec. 91, was withdrawn in the second anquisitio; Ascon. 19, 21 f.; (Aurel. Vict.)
<i>Vir. Ill.</i> 72. 11; Quintil. v. 12. 10; Cic. <i>Scaur.</i> 1, 3; <i>Sest.</i> 47. 101.—(6) L. Cornelius
Merula and Q. Lutatius Catulus, 87, avoided trial, probably for perduellio, by
suicide; Diod. xxxviii. 4; Appian, <i>B. C.</i> i. 74. 341 f.—(7) On the first day of the
following year, 86, P. Popillius Laenas, tribune of the plebs, hurled from the Tarpeian
Rock Sextus Lucilius (or Licinius?), tribune of the preceding year, and set a
day of trial for the colleagues of the latter. The accused fled to Sulla and in their
absence were interdicted from fire and water. They were charged with perduellio;
their offence was the veto of the popular measures of Cornelius Cinna. This is the
only certain case of calling retired tribunes to account for their official conduct, and
may be regarded as a symptom of the revolution then in progress; Vell. ii. 24;
Livy, ep. lxxx; Dio Cass. Frag. 102. 12; Plut. <i>Mar.</i> 45.</p>

that after it was dropped no further accusation was brought. Wirz, ibid., supposes
that the senate quashed the process of the duumviri on the ground of illegality, that
the accuser (Labienus) then brought a tribunician accusation for perduellio, but
intimated a possible finable action in addition, and that the trial was ended, without
resumption, by the hauling down of the flag.</p>

practice; Livy iii. 11. 8; xxv. 3 f.; Dion. Hal. x. 41 f.; Cic. <i>Inv.</i> ii. 17. 52; Val.

form of assembly which received appeals in tribunician capital cases is represented
by Cicero, in whose opinion the comitia centuriata were established as the sole power
to judge concerning the caput of a citizen even in pre-decemviral time by the leges
sacratae (<i>Sest.</i> 30. 65); and accordingly he believes that the sentence of exile was
passed on Kaeso Quinctius by that body (<i>Dom.</i> 32. 86). But in this opinion Cicero’s
personal bias already referred to (p. 267, n. 6) cannot be neglected: in discrediting
the decree of exile passed against himself by the tribal comitia, it was agreeable to
his purpose to deny that this assembly ever had enjoyed such competence. The
view given in the text, represented by the annalists and confirmed by a law of the

from two to five. Dio Cassius probably placed the increase from five to ten at this
date; Zon. vii. 15. 1; 17. 6; Dio Cass. Frag. 22. 1. In the opinion of Meyer, in
<i>Hermes</i>, xxx (1895). 1-24; <i>Gesch. d. Alt.</i> v. 141 f., the plebeian tribunate was instituted
at this time and the original number was four; cf. p. 55, n. 1 above. But
Diodorus does not say so; indeed his grouping of the four tribunes in pairs suggests
a doubling—a fact which he has perhaps condensed from his source.</p>

called for voting, the dictator, accompanied by a crowd of patricians, took a seat in
the assembly and supported the tribunician protest; Livy vi. 38. 5 ff. On another
occasion some years earlier the patres old and young came into the Forum, and taking
their places in the several tribes, appealed to their tribesmen to vote against the
proposal of the tribunes; Livy v. 30. 4 f. Still earlier C. Claudius and other senior
patricians spoke in a tribunician assembly against the measure then before the plebs.
Soltau’s objection (<i>Berl. Stud.</i> ii. 47) to the interpretation here represented has little

<p>The first triumph by order of the people, without the consent of the senate, according
to Livy iii. 63. 11 (cf. Dion. Hal. xi. 50. 1), took place in 449. It is to be
noticed, however, that a magistrate always had a right to triumph without permission
either of the senate or of the people (Mommsen, <i>Röm. Forsch.</i> i. 214 f.), provided
he paid his own expenses; Polyb. vi. 15. 8; Livy xxxiii. 23. 8. The resolution
of the people on this occasion, if historical, may have been a mere pledge of
sympathy and confidence; cf. p. 293. But Herzog, <i>Röm. Staatsverf.</i> i. 194, doubts
its reality.</p>

<p>The “ancient law long ago abolished,” which required the consent of the senate
to proposals brought before the people, and which Sulla is said to have renewed
(Appian, <i>B. C.</i> i. 59. 266; cf. p. 406), is ordinarily referred, as by Mommsen,
<i>Röm. Staatsr.</i> iii. 158; Herzog, <i>Röm. Staatsverf.</i> i. 193, to the condition on the
validity of the plebiscite under discussion. Appian may have had this restriction in
mind, for we know at least that under the constitution as reformed by Sulla the
tribunes did propose laws de senatus sententia; <i>CIL.</i> i. 204 (year 71); Bruns, <i>Font.
Iur.</i> 94; Girard, <i>Textes</i>, 66; Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i> iii. 154; Mommsen, <i>Röm. Staatsr.</i>

which made the consent of the senate essential to the validity of the plebiscite does
not appear to be well considered. Had the tribunes not been bound by written
enactment, they would have felt themselves free to legislate without the senate’s
coöperation, and even the law they tried in vain to disregard.</p>

informs us that such a protest was disregarded by the magistrate. We may suppose
that in this period they often attempted the power, but usually without success.
They possessed a growing influence in the right to address the people, which must
often have added an overwhelming force to their protests; cf. Livy iv. 25. 1 (434);
58. 14 (406); v. 2. 2 ff. (403); ch. 6 (403). This kind of obstruction may be meant

prefers a date shortly after the close of the war with Hannibal. Soltau, controverting
Niese’s view, insists that the chief regulation mentioned by Livy—the limitation
of occupation to five hundred iugera—belongs to Licinius and Sextius, and that the
article was afterward renewed, with the addition of the other provisions stated by
Appian, probably about the time of the Hortensian legislation. Against the earlier
date is especially urged the circumstance that the large number of iugera allowed to
the individual is incongruous with the narrow limits of the Roman territory at that
time. The provision for the relief of debtors, too, has the appearance of an anticipation
of a plebiscite on the same subject passed in 447; p. 298 below; cf. Matzat,

owed its existence to a law is an inference from the circumstances. The form of
assembly is unknown. With this Valerian-Marcian law, 352, Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i> ii.
621 f., conjecturally identifies the lex Marcia against usurers; Gaius iv. 23. In his
opinion also (ibid. ii. 622; cf. Rudorff, <i>Röm. Rechtsgesch.</i> i. 51) the lex Furia de
sponsu mentioned by Gaius, iii. 121; iv. 22, “discharging the sponsor and fide-promissor
of liability in two years and limiting the liability of each to a proportionate
part” (Poste’s interpretation) belongs to L. Furius, dictator in 345 (Livy vii. 28. 2);
whereas others assign it to the year 95 (cf. Poste, <i>Gai. Inst.</i> 359) and others to a
time subsequent to Cicero (cf. Roby, <i>Rom. Priv. Law</i>, ii. 30). It was later than the
lex Appuleia de sponsu, which is referred to by Gaius iii. 122, and which must have
been enacted after the establishment of the provincial system. It is to be attributed,
accordingly, to the famous tribune of 103, 100 (Poste, ibid. 359) rather than to the
like-named tribune of 390 (Livy v. 32. 8; Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i> ii. 621). These considerations
render the later dating of the lex Furia the more probable. The lex
Publilia de sponsu, the date of which is also unknown, granted the surety (sponsor)
an action against the principal debtor in case the latter failed to reimburse him
within six months; Gaius iii. 127; iv. 22, cf. 171.</p>

is incompatible with the legal exclusion of the patricians from that form of assembly
(p. 129 f.); (3) that on one occasion, 209, after the Hortensian legislation Livy
(xxvii. 21. 1-4) represents the voting assembly under tribunician presidency as
composed not only of plebs but of all ranks (concursu plebisque et omnium ordinum),
and that the patricians were evidently free to take part in the debates of
the concilium; cf. Livy xliii. 16. 8; (4) Caesar, <i>B. C.</i> iii. 1, seems to represent
the praetors and tribunes as presiding together over the same comitia (“praetoribus

no difference of composition existed between the pretorian and the tribunician
assemblies of tribes.</p>

proved by Livy, ep. xii; Dio Cass. Frag. 39. 4. Probably the triumviri capitales,
289, were created by a similar act of the tribes; Livy, ep. xi; p. 312.</p>

introduced by a tribune of the plebs, was vetoed by a colleague; Livy iv. 49. 6;

this field. The only other instance of popular legislation in this period touching
state economy was the plebiscite of M. Lucretius, 172 (Livy xlii. 19. 1 f.; cf.

directed the censors to farm the vectigalia of Campania; p. 337 above.—In 169 a
tribunician rogation of P. Rutilius threatened to annul the censorial contracts (Livy
xliii. 16. 6) as a rebuke to the censors for their arbitrary management of the business.
When this object was secured, the bill was allowed to drop. It is true, as
Ihne, <i>Hist. of Rome</i>, iv. 24, n. 1, remarks, that no one questioned the right of the
people to cancel an administrative act of the censors; but it was quite another thing
to find a college of tribunes unanimously disposed to interfere. The significant fact
is that in all the time between the peace with Hannibal and the tribunate of Ti.
Gracchus no important financial act was passed by the comitia.</p>

public lands surrendered by them to the government for colonial purposes; cf. § 31.
Doubtless a similar provision was included in the statute of Tiberius. Although
viritim assignments had hitherto benefited citizens only, Latins and Italians had been
admitted to Latin colonies founded by Rome; Meyer, <i>Gesch. d. Gracch.</i> 91.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2316" href="#FNanchor_2316" class="label">[2316]</a> The epitomator of Livy, lx, supposes that Gaius offered and actually carried a
measure for adding six hundred knights to the senate with the understanding that
the jurors were to be drawn from that body thus enlarged; cf. Mommsen, <i>Röm. Staatsr.</i>
iii. 530, n. 1. Such an act, however, could not have been termed a lex iudiciaria, as
it would have been concerned simply with the composition of the senate. Everything
is opposed to the assumption that the bill in this form passed or at least that it was
put into effect. Plutarch, <i>C. Gracch.</i> 5 f., seems to signify that his law provided for
an album of six hundred jurors, one half to be drawn from the senate, the rest from
the knights. It is by no means necessary, with Fowler, in <i>Eng. Hist. Rev.</i> xx (1905).
426, n. 16, to interpret the expression ὁ δὲ τριακοσίους τῶν ἱππέων προσκατέλεξεν αὐτοῖς
οὖσι τριακοσίοις, καὶ τὰς κρίσεις κοινὰς τῶν ἑξακοσίωον ἐποίησε (cf. <i>Ag. et Cleom. et Gracch.</i>
<i>Comp.</i> 2) as “adding three hundred equites to the senate to form the body of iudices.”

Strachan-Davidson, <i>Appian</i>, p. 23.</p>

Mommsen supplied the lacuna with a statement of the money qualification as here
given; but afterward, changing his mind, he filled the gap with “equum publicum

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2341" href="#FNanchor_2341" class="label">[2341]</a> The whole tenor of Cicero’s <i>Pro Cluentio</i> is to the effect that the knights were
not bound by the provision against bribery. He had a strong motive, however,
for bringing into prominence the article which provided for the punishment of magistrates
and senators, and for suppressing the one, if there was one, concerning the
punishment of equites; and this suppression was rendered easy by the fact that the
Cornelian law then in force mentioned senatorial jurors only. Appian, <i>B. C.</i> i. 22.
97 (cf. 35. 158, 161), assumes that under the Sempronian law there were trials for
the bribery of jurors, rendered useless, however, and finally done away with by the
conspiracy and violence of the knights; cf. Lengle, <i>Sull. Verf.</i> 18 f. This interpretation
of the known facts seems preferable to the view of Cicero, which, however, is
accepted by most scholars; cf. Mommsen, <i>Röm. Strafr.</i> 635; Greenidge, <i>Leg. Proced.</i>

was dropped before being brought to vote. Gaius might have prevented both by
his veto (Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i> iii. 45); but even if he felt the intention to be mischievous,
he could not have afforded to oppose so popular measures. Mommsen, in <i>CIL.</i>
i. p. 87, is of the opinion that Minervia may have been a Livian colony; but he cannot
understand why the others provided for were not founded. The reason doubtless

.... qui agrum publicum vitiosa et inutili lege vectigali levavit”). By interpreting
this sentence “Sp. Thorius ... who relieved the public land of a defective
and useless law by the imposition of a vectigal,” Mommsen (in <i>Verhdl. sächs. Gesellsch.
d. Wiss.</i> 92 f.) attempts to bring Cicero into agreement with Appian. But the interpretation
is violent and is not generally accepted. The statement of Cicero applies
to the law of 111 far better than to that which Appian mentions under the name of
Borius.</p>

he established a special court and in his second by his lex maiestatis a quaestio
perpetua. Mühl, <i>App. Sat.</i> 74, also strongly favors the second. The statement of
Gran. Licin. xxxiii (?). 4—“Cn. Manilius (for Manlius or Mallius; cf. <i>CIL.</i> i².
p. 152 f.) ob eandem causam quam et Cepio L. Saturnini rogatione e civitate est cito
(for plebiscito?) eiectus”—Lange applies to the rogation for a special court.
The circumstance that the trial of Norbanus took place no less than five years
after the enactment of the law and the general tenor of Cicero’s account of that

<p><a id="Footnote_2496" href="#FNanchor_2496" class="label">[2496]</a> This is an inference from the fact that the court which tried Cn. Pompeius
Strabo in 88, and which sat under the Varian law, was composed in accordance with
the subsequent Plautian judiciary law (Cic. Frag. A. vii. <i>Cornel.</i> i. 53). A special
court was composed in no other way than by the law which established it. In
general on the Varian law, see Ascon. 21 f., 73, 79; Val. Max. viii. 6. 4; App.
<i>B. C.</i> i. 37; Cic. <i>Tusc.</i> ii. 24. 57. From Appian we learn that the law was passed
before the outbreak of the Social War, and Cicero, <i>Brut.</i> 89. 305, informs us that the
prosecutions under it continued through the war. The last trial mentioned is that
of Cn. Pompeius Strabo in 88, referred to above. See also Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i> iii. 108;

Plut. <i>Mar.</i> 35; Schol. Gronov. 410) speaks only of the transfer of the command.
That the fourth article was added after the departure of Sulla from Rome, and that
the latter knew nothing of it till summoned to deliver up his command is clearly
stated by Appian, ibid. ch. 56 f.; cf. Fröhlich, in Pauly-Wissowa, <i>Real-Encycl.</i> iv.

<p><a id="Footnote_2528" href="#FNanchor_2528" class="label">[2528]</a> This view is held by Sunden, <i>De trib. pot. imm.</i> (1897) 21 ff.; Meyer, ibid.
652-4; Vassis, in <i>Athena</i>, xii (1900). 54-7. Fröhlich, in Pauly-Wissowa, <i>Real-Encycl.</i>
iv. 1537, supposes that elections simply were thereby transferred to the comitia centuriata;
but the word χειροτονίαι used by Appian, though often denoting elections
(as in <i>B. C.</i> i. 14. 58-60; 15. 66; 28. 127, where the meaning is easily derived from
the context), includes also voting on laws, as in <i>B. C.</i> i. 23. 100; 55. 244. Had he
meant elections, he would here have written ἀρχαιρεσία (cf. i. 1. 1; 44. 196), as otherwise
the meaning would have been doubtful. The view represented by Fröhlich,
moreover, would in no way explain the passage, nor was it likely that Sulla would
leave to the tribes the ratification of laws but deprive them of the politically unimportant
right to elect minor officials.</p>

267) imply an extensive curtailment of the tribunician power not definitely specified.
The statement of Livy, ep. lxxxix, that Sulla afterward (82) deprived the tribunes of
all legislative power (p. 413 below) is not true of his dictatorial law-giving, but belongs
properly to the year under consideration.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2530" href="#FNanchor_2530" class="label">[2530]</a> Lengle (<i>Sull. Verf.</i> 10) argues, on the contrary, that the measure could be
intended for the tribunes only, because, as he supposes, a patrician magistrate always
consulted the senate concerning his legislative proposals. But Lengle has reckoned
without the facts. An examination of the sources will show that from the time of
the dictator Publilius Philo (Livy viii. 12. 14) to the time of the dictator Julius
Caesar (Dio Cass. xxxviii. 3 f.; Plut. <i>Caes.</i> 14; App. <i>B. C.</i> ii. 10) patrician magistrates
occasionally brought rogations before the comitia without the senatorial sanction.
But it is possible that in speaking of “an ancient law long disused” (p. 406,
n. 2) Appian may wrongly have had in mind the pre-Hortensian restriction on the
plebiscite; p. 277, n. 4.</p>

for the view it presents, that he absolutely deprived the tribunes of legislative initiative,
were it not that under his constitutional arrangements they actually proposed
laws de senatus sententia; <i>CIL.</i> i. 204 (year 71); Bruns, <i>Font. iur.</i> p. 94; Dessau,

Scipio, mentioned by Cic. <i>Phil.</i> xii. 11. 27, referred to this arrangement. Sunden, <i>De

the right of the tribunes to propose laws, refuses to accept 71 as the date of the epigraphic
lex above mentioned.</p>

<p>It seems probable (Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i> iii. 175; Mommsen, <i>Röm. Strafr.</i> 654,
n. 2), though it is not certain (Greenidge, <i>Leg. Proced.</i> 424, 430 f.), that the lex
Plautia de vi was proposed by a tribune of 78 or 77 as the agent of Q. Lutatius
Catulus, proconsul; Sall. <i>Cat.</i> 31; Schol. Bob. 368; Cic. <i>Cael.</i> 29. 70; p. 424
below. Probably the lex Plautia which recalled from exile L. Cornelius Cinna,
brother-in-law of Caesar, and others who, having shared in the insurrection of Lepidus,
had gone over to Sertorius, was a plebiscite de senatus sententia of 73; Suet.

For other laws, see p. 424.</p>

<p>The statement of Livy’s epitomator concerning the lex Cornelia de tribunicia potestate
would apply more accurately to the Cornelian-Pompeian law of 88; p. 406.</p>

the Cornelian government no tribunician contio was held; but we know that this is
not true. In 76 a contio was summoned by L. Sicinius, tribune of the plebs; <i>Orat.</i>
of Licinius Macer, in Sall. <i>Hist.</i> iii. 48. 8: “L. Sicinius primus de potestate tribunicia
loqui ausus mussantibus vobis”; cf. Pseud. Ascon. 103; Plut. <i>Caes.</i> 7; Cic.
<i>Brut.</i> 60. 216 f. In 74 the tribune Quinctius held contiones; Cic. <i>Cluent.</i> 34. 93;
Sall. <i>Hist.</i> ibid. § 11. The oration of Licinius Macer, quoted by Sallust, <i>Hist.</i> iii.
48, is a tribunician harangue. Finally in 71 the tribune Palicanus held a contio
outside the city that Pompey might attend; p. 426.</p>

chapter of this law concerning the twenty quaestors is preserved in an inscription;
<i>CIL.</i> i. 202; Bruns, <i>Font. Iur.</i> p. 90; Girard, <i>Textes</i>, p. 64. It regulates the qualifications,
appointment, and pay of the apparitores of the quaestors. An important
fact derived from the praescriptio is that the law was adopted in the tribal assembly.
Since in the case of one law the centuriate assembly is mentioned as if exceptional
(p. 422), we may infer that most of Sulla’s enactments were tribal. On the apparitores,
see Mommsen, in <i>Rhein. Mus.</i> N. F. vi (1846). 1-57; <i>Röm. Staatsr.</i> i. 332-46;

de adulteriis et pudicitia, for it is doubtful whether Sulla’s ordinance περὶ γάμων

Sull.</i> 3; cf. <i>Dig.</i> xlviii. 5. 23. It seems to be demonstrated, however, by Voigt, in

this offence, including the Cornelian, were sumptuary; cf. Cuq, in Daremberg et

repeal of his own laws, whereupon Asconius comments that he can find the mention of
no law of his except the one concerning retired tribunes above described. Cicero,

Cicero was of the opinion that this district could provide not more than five thousand
with lots of ten iugera, Suetonius and Velleius state that twenty thousand were settled
in it. Some Campanian land remained undivided in 51; Cic. <i>Fam.</i> viii. 10. 4.
Many settlements under the Julian law are mentioned in the <i>liber coloniarum</i>, in
Gromat. 210, 220, 231, 235, 239, 259, 260.</p>

<p>It was in accord with Caesar’s policy of colonization and of the extension of the
franchise that P. Vatinius, tribune of the plebs in this year, carried a law for sending
five thousand new settlers to Comum, a Latin colony in northern Italy. Some of
the new residents he honored with the citizenship; Strabo v. 16; Suet. <i>Caes.</i> 28;
App. <i>B. C.</i> ii. 26. 98; Plut. <i>Caes.</i> 29; Cic. <i>Att.</i> v. 11. 2; <i>Fam.</i> xiii. 35. 1. The
franchise was afterward withdrawn by a decree of the senate; Suet. and Plut. ibid.</p>

<p>Supplementary to these Julian laws is the lex Mamilia Roscia Peducaea Alliena
Fabia, three articles of which are contained in Gromat. 263-6; Bruns, <i>Font. Iur.</i>
96-8; Girard, <i>Textes</i>, 69 f. Other references to a lex Mamilia are Gromat. 11. 5;
12. 12; 37. 24; 144. 19; 169. 7; Cic. <i>Leg.</i> i. 21. 55. The last proves it to have been
passed before 51. The seeming citation of the third article as an agrarian law of
Gaius Caesar by <i>Dig.</i> xlvii. 21. 3, may indicate merely a borrowing of this article
from the earlier law of Caesar, just as article 2 is substantially repeated in <i>Lex Col.
Genet.</i> 104. Mommsen, in <i>Röm. Feldmess.</i> ii. 221-6; <i>Röm. Staatsr.</i> ii. 628, n. 4,
considers it the work of a second sub-committee (Vviri) of the vigintiviri provided
for by the agrarian law, enacted to furnish rules for the administration of the latter.
Lange (<i>Röm. Alt.</i> ii. 690; iii. 288) and more decidedly Willems (<i>Sén. Rom.</i> i. 498,
n. 5) prefer to regard it as a tribunician law and to assign it to 55.</p>

of five modii of grain to the citizen, at what price and at what interval is

His most famous colonies were Carthage (App. <i>Lib.</i> 136; Dio Cass. xliii. 50. 3 f.;
Plut. <i>Caes.</i> 57; Strabo xvii. 3. 5) and Corinth (Dio Cass. ibid. § 4; Plut. ibid.;

law of Antonius for the founding of the colony, supplemented by a plebiscite of

lex Rubria cited in § 20 is not this document but an earlier plebiscite, the name
of the author has not been determined. It regulated the administration of justice in
Cisalpina, which remained a province till 42. The fragment of a law found at Ateste
(Bruns, ibid. 102 f.; Girard, <i>Textes</i>, (76-8) is of the same nature and belongs to the

and 2 with articles 3-5 formed a lex satura (p. 396) having no other motive than
convenience. Hackel, <i>Wien. Stud.</i> xxiv. 560, supposes that Caesar had intended to
bring the provisions of this measure before the comitia as two separate laws, but in
his haste to be off for Spain, combined them in one. At all events the interpretation
given above is true of the result if not of the intention.</p>

After the Antonian laws had been annulled by the senate, February, 43, on the
ground that they had been passed with violence and contrary to the auspices (Cic.
<i>Phil.</i> vi. 2. 3; Dio Cass. xlv. 27), the acts of Caesar are confirmed anew by a
centuriate law of C. Vibius Pansa, consul in that year; Cic. <i>Phil.</i> x. 8. 17; Lange,
<i>Röm. Alt.</i> iii. 526. The policy of using the departed Caesar as a means of self-aggrandizement
readily lent itself to Octavianus, at whose instigation Q. Pedius, his colleague
in the consulship in 43, caused a comitial act to be passed for the establishment
of a special court to try the murderers of the dictator. The act specified the
punishment to be inflicted on the guilty and offered rewards to informers; Vell.

Lange, <i>Röm. Alt.</i> ii. 483, that the right to vote in a tribe drawn thus by lot was not
restricted to those who were virtually citizens awaiting enrolment. It is probable
that, at least in early time, not even residence was a requirement; cf. Mommsen,

<p><a id="Footnote_2979" href="#FNanchor_2979" class="label">[2979]</a> In the opinion of Mommsen, <i>Röm. Staatsr.</i> iii. 397, n. 4, 411, n. 7; <i>Abhdl.
sächs. Gesellsch. d. Wiss.</i> ii (1857). 426, n. 107, the principium had nothing to do
with the order of voting. His argument is based chiefly on the fact that according
to the <i>Lex Mal.</i> 55—a constitution evidently based in large part on that of Rome—the
curiae voted simultaneously. Reference to the preliminary vote of a single
Roman tribe, however, is made by Plut. <i>Aemil.</i> 31; App. <i>B. C.</i> i. 12. 52. Furthermore
it is difficult to understand why so great importance should attach to the
principium on Mommsen’s supposition that it had merely to do with the order of
announcement after the simultaneous vote of all the tribes. His view is accepted by
Liebenam, in Pauly-Wissowa, <i>Real-Encycl.</i> iv. 684, but rejected by Lange, <i>Kl. Schr.</i>
ii. 477 f.; Herzog, <i>Röm. Staatsverf.</i> 1184, and ignored by most other writers, including
Liebenam, inconsistently; ibid. 706.</p>

<p class="center mt2 larger">BOOKS ON ROMAN SOCIETY</p>

<p class="noindent mt2">By W. WARDE FOWLER</p>

<p class="center larger">Social Life at Rome in the Age of Cicero</p>

<p class="center"><i>Cloth, Illustrated, 8vo, $2.25 net</i></p>

<p>A notable example of the kind of history that deals with men rather than
with institutions and events is “Social Life at Rome in the Age of Cicero,”
by the learned scholar and fascinating writer W. Warde Fowler. The book
was originally intended as a companion to Professor Tucker’s “Life in Ancient
Athens”; but it grew beyond the limits of that volume because of the wealth
of material Mr. Fowler felt himself compelled to utilize. As the author points
out in his preface, there is no book in the English language which supplies a
picture of life and manners, of education, morals, and religion, in the intensely
interesting period of the Roman Republic. The age of Cicero is one of the
most important periods of Roman history, and the Ciceronian correspondence,
of more than nine hundred contemporary letters, is the richest treasure-house
of social life that has survived from any period of classical antiquity.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Second edition, Cloth, 8vo, $2.50 net</i></p>

<p>“The most important contribution yet made in English to our knowledge
of the way in which all classes of Roman society, including the aristocracy,
the plebeians, the freedmen and the slaves, ordinarily lived in the relatively
happy age of the Antonines is presented in this admirable work, not one of
whose fifteen chapters is devoid of illumination and fascination.... It
should be distinctly understood that this work is the product of first-hand,
not second-hand, erudition and investigation.... This book is what it
purports to be, a social, not a political history.”—M. W. H. in <i>New York Sun</i>.</p>

<p>“We want to emphasize the point that this volume is not a mere raking
over of dry bones, with nothing but an antiquarian interest for the reader of
to-day. It is more vital to the student of modern social, religious, and political
tendencies than a large share of the strictly modern sociological theses,
studies, and dissertations now issuing in such profusion from the workshops
of the doctor-making universities. And, aside from its inherent importance,
its thoughts are so lucidly and attractively expressed that no intelligent
reader, whether a Latinist or not, can fail to find it pleasant reading.”—<i>The
Evening Post</i>, New York.</p>

<p class="center larger">The Acropolis of Athens</p>

<p class="center"><i>Cloth, Illustrated, 8vo, $4.00 net</i></p>

<p>“This handsome book embodies the results of a number of years of study
and of repeated visits to Athens, where in 1886-87 author was director of
the American School of Classical Studies. While some of the older problems
connected with the history of the Acropolis have been solved by the aid of
the discoveries completed in 1889, others have been raised which await further
light. A final satisfactory history of the Acropolis and its monuments may
never be written, but this work gives a summary of the most important contributions
to its history and states the results of the author’s study of the site
and of the ruins upon it.”</p>

<p>His new book is published as a companion volume to Professor Seymour’s
“Life in the Homeric Age,” which proved so popular. It is designed both for
readers who have a general interest in Greek history and Greek art and for
students and visitors at Athens who desire to use a handbook upon the spot.
The history of the Acropolis is traced from the time of its earliest occupation
down to the present, and the volume is handsomely illustrated.</p>

<p class="center larger">Life in the Homeric Age</p>

<p class="center"><i>Decorated cloth, gilt top, 8vo, illustrated, $4.00 net</i></p>

<p>A study of the inhabitants of Greece and the Levant at the period of the
Homeric Poems which furnishes a clear and fairly complete picture of
the life which was familiar to them. “From the poet’s language,” the author
says, “he has attempted to discover what was before the poet’s mind....
Homer’s picture of the life of his age is of particular interest to the modern
reader since it is the earliest account extant of the culture from which our
own is a true lineal descendant.”</p>

<p>“Absolutely free from speculation and controversy, the volume will surely
prove valuable to every student of Greek life and literature. It has the
further advantage of being the only work of its kind on the English book
market to-day.”—<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>

<p class="center">By T. G. TUCKER, Litt.D.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Cloth, illustrated, 8vo, $1.25 net; by mail $1.40</i></p>

<p>“There’s nothing dusty, fusty, musty, about this book.... Evidences of
a mastery of the subject abound everywhere.... When you get through
the book you will believe that Athens is just around the corner, and you will
know its people in nature and in habits better than you do the dwellers in
the apartment house next door.”—<i>The Cleveland Leader.</i></p>
